    "biography": "Alexandre Mimoglou has worked throughout his life as an architect, urban planner, painter, and designer. He was born in Greece in 1954, and established himself in France in 1971. He studied architecture and urban planning in Paris from 1979-1980, and then aesthetics at the Sorbonne in 1982. During the 1980\u2019s he became interested in systematic studies of real and imagined environments. Mimoglou explores these theoretical concepts within his designs, which replicate the sense of movement one encounters flowing through urban spaces. \nIn 1982 Mimoglou was commissioned by Knoll International to create a collection of drapery fabrics which were exclusively distributed in Europe. The collection was featured at the Knoll International showrooms in Frankfurt and Paris in 1983. \nIn addition to his textile designs for Knoll, Mimoglou also created textiles for interiors and furniture for Pierre Frey and Bucol in 1982. In 1984 he designed porcelain prototypes for Rosenthal. His work was exhibited at the \"Salon des Artistes Decorateurs 1985\" at the Grand Palais Museum. His work has been recognized internationally and by the Association of Friends of the City of Paris\u2019 Modern Art Museum. \nHe is the owner and Chairman of EURAN, European Art Networks AB, which organizes the sale of artworks in museums and galleries via an online store.",
