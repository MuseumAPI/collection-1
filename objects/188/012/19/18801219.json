    "description":"The stomacher front is fabricated of heavily embroidered linen plain weave, lined with a block-printed linen fabric, and stiffened with ribs of an unidentified material. The upper edge is slightly u-shaped, and the point finishes in an arrow-head with three independent tabs on either side.  The embroidery is executed in silver-colored metal foil wrapped around a white silk core, couched to the linen. While the metal threads are laid on horizontally, the couching stitches follow a \"V\" pattern. Decoration in the form of a rose tied with a bow was made separately from red and green silk and gold foil wrapped silk in a needle-lace technique; it is sewn on top of the silver couching. The embroidered center panel is trimmed with white silk piping and a narrow woven metal ribbon. The block printed linen lining has a pattern of small birds in a scrolling vine in red on white.",
