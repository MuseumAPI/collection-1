  "description": "Sampler with two scenes, a verse and inscription, and a stylized acorn border on four sides. The upper scene shows a house, another small building with a fence, a large branching tree and a smaller fruit tree, with birds. A single alphabet and set of numerals at the very top. The lower register shows three green trees side by side, with smaller trees in the spaces between. The two scenes are separated by the following lines: \r\nFragrant the rose is but it fades in time\r\nthe violet sweet but quickly past its prime\r\nwhile lilies hang their heads and soon decay\r\nand whither snow in minutes melt away\r\nsuch and so with'ring are our early joys\r\nwhich time or sickness speedily destroys\r\n\r\nHetty Lees Her Work Done in the Tenth Year of Her Age July the 17 1799",
