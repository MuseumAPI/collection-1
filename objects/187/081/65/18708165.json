    "description": "The Blue Room, most likely a dining room, is decorated in the Gothic Revival Style. \nA view of the beautiful countryside of Silesia is visible through the center window, with its stained glass upper transom, located in the seating alcove. The entrance to the alcove is hung with a blue-tasseled pelmet and white curtains. A religious painting, at left, is juxtaposed with flowers, plants, a desk, an etagere and a dining table, elements of a comfortable room in a country house. Both the green rug, bordered in a rose-flower pattern, and the central chandelier are influenced by Victorian decoration. An adjacent room, in pink tones, is seen at right.",
