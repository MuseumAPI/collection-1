    "biography": "William Grueby founded this pottery in 1894.  It produced highly acclaimed art pottery, including the famous matte green glazed vases, winning two gold medals, for enamels and glazes and for his personal accomplishment in creating the dull-finished enamels, and a silver medal for pottery design at the 1900 Paris Exposition, and a grand prize at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  Its style and glazing were copied by others, and ultimately it went through a bankruptcy.  The financial problems resulted in the incorporation of the Grueby Pottery Co. and later the Grueby Faience and Tile Company.  Over time, the firm shifted its focus to architectural faience.  The tiles continued to be produced from 1919 until at least 1928 by the Pardee Tile Works in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which bought Grueby\u2019s company (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",
