    "biography": "Lost somewhere between the dream world and the state of awakening is where one finds the surrealistic works of Kustaa Saksi. This pattern designer and textile artist mixes the sinuous lines of art nouveau with the psychedelic colors of pop art to create designs inspired by his memories of growing up in Kouvola, Finland. Trained in graphic design at the Lahti Institute of Design and Fine Arts, Saksi has applied his vision to textiles, patterns, spaces, and objects. The textiles blend rubber, acrylic, lurex, and phosphorescent yarn with mohair and cashmere wool. Saksi moved to Paris in 2004 and now works in Amsterdam, where his studio occupies an old cigar factory.",
