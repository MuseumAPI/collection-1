  "description": "Pleated fan. Front and back leaves of hand-colored etching on paper; sticks of bone; mother-of-pearl washer at the rivet. The images on the front, explained in French on the back, satarize the separation of America from England and the 1778 treaty subsequently signed between America and France. England is represented by the placid cow and the recumbent lion, tamed and controlled by the Dutch, the Spanish, and the French.",
