    "justification": "Alexander Girard believed that modernism did not need to be dull or drab; he called his approach \u201caesthetic functionalism\u201d\u2014the way design made you feel mattered just as much as its utilitarian value. He is known for his use of bright colors and bold geometric patterns at a time when solids and grays were the predominant modernist choices. Aside from his work for firms like Herman Miller and the John Deere Company, one of Girard\u2019s biggest clients in the mid-1960s was Braniff International Airways. Tasked with creating an eye-catching visual identity for the airline, he made over 17,500 design changes ranging from Braniff\u2019s logo to its ground equipment. He developed with Braniff the \u201cend of the plain plane\u201d advertising campaign. With his usual flair for color and pattern, Girard worked on everything from branded playing cards, the plane fleet itself, to terminal interiors, including this chair design for use in Braniff lounges. He designed this&amp;nbsp;rectilinear armchair&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;rounded corners in a low profile to accommodate contemporary low-ceilinged spaces.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He also felt that the resulting reduction in visual scale would create a feeling of repose. Girard intended his Brannif furniture to exemplify comfort, luxury and elegance using old and new&amp;nbsp;materials and techniques, which are evident in the chair's&amp;nbsp;clarity of structure as well: the components\u2014upholstered, foam-covered&amp;nbsp;molded plywood&amp;nbsp;seat and back, each with a&amp;nbsp;strip of welting; a separate foam seat cushion covered in a contrasting fabric; cast aluminum legs and back posts\u2014are clearly articulated&amp;nbsp;through color,&amp;nbsp;line,&amp;nbsp;and pattern. Originally from a Braniff interior, this chair retains its metal Braniff property tag on the underside of the seat. \nIn 1967, Herman Miller introduced a line of furnishings, the Girard Group, consisting of 25 pieces in total based on his Braniff designs, but they were only manufactured for about one year. Girard wrote in the product brochure: \u201cThe outer shell may be upholstered or painted and the welt selected in one of three coordinating colors. The inner shell and cushion may be upholstered in a variety of fabrics. The permutations are infinite.\u201d The mix-and-match possibilities may have been too overwhelming for consumers at the time, but because of the short production period, these items are now highly desirable.",
