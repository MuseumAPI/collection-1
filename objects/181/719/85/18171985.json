Attributes of the Arts are shown in triangular pediments above the entrances.  Four statues of allegorical women flanking the entrances represent possibly the Muses.  The pavilions are connected by a colonnade of embedded Doric columns and a short top story.  In each interval (between the columns) are a two-story window and a regular window.  Circular windows are placed at the basement level, below the colonnade.  Below the rendering are the rule \"12 Toises\" and the scale \"48 modules.\"  Inscription on verso.",
