    "description": "Horizontal rectangle. The ceiling is slightly vaulted. More than the lower half is shown. In the center is a broad octagonal representation: soldiers lead a man away from his wife and two children. She is kneeling before a potentate who is sitting upon a throne. Two men with swords are threatening her. The panel is framed by an entablature shown from below. The remaining spae is divided into spheric quadrangles and triangles, those in the corners are treated as loggias with standing trophies of arms. Above these are representations of fighting, armed riders. Outside is a moulding. The caption is cut off. On the back is the plan of a ceiling, pen, ink.",
