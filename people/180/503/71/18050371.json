    "biography": "De Wolfe is considered by some to have invented the profession of interior design. She was called Lady Mendl, a socialite, known for her interiors and style in New York, Paris and London.  Her clients included Anne Vanderbilt, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and the Fricks, among many others. Rejecting dark Victorian style, de Wolfe embraced light and fresh colors with Chinoiserie, comfort and 18th-century palette.",
