    "biography": "Marc Camille Chaimowicz established himself as an artist in the 1970\u2019s with his evocative installations and performances. In an era of minimalism, Chaimowicz openly pursued works which were playful and theatrical. He created \u201cscatter environments\u201d which were installations based on everything from pop culture to French literature. His mixed-media installations often included elements of interior design such as photographs, fabric prototypes, wallpaper and ceramics. Chaimowicz\u2019s works were some of the first to blur the line between performance and installation. His installations produced environments with music and objects that raised questions about the boundaries of art and design. These works represented the changing relationships between art, design, pop culture, and performance at the time. \n\nChaimowicz received his MFA in Painting from Slade School of Fine Art at University College and his BFA at Camberwell College of Arts.",
