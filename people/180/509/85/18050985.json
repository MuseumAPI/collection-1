    "biography": "Bruce Metcalf was born on in Amherst, MA. He obtained his BFA in 1972 from Syracuse University and his MFA in 1977 from Tyler School of Art at Temple University. He is known for his work with non-traditional materials like wood, metal and plexiglass.\n\nCreating pieces outside of traditional goldsmithed jewelry, Metcalf's world is often filled with distorted, colorful and minaturized forms and figures. His jewelry reflects his studies of architecture and his work as a comic book illustrator, and is mainly composed of colorful wooden forms clustered together with repurposed objects suggesting plants or body parts, along with organically shaped metal pieces. Most of Metcalf's works express his sense of whimsy, or comment on the human condition. Metcalf's jewelry has earned international recognition, and is in a number of museum collections. In addition to creating jewelry, he is also a writer and critic within the art jewelry world.",
