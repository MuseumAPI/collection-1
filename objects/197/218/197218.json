  "description": "The thirty-odd page multicolored gift catalog displays products designed by M&Co Labs: watches, clocks, paperweights, and fake books. Photographs of the items are accompanied by brief descriptions. \r\n\r\nIn the center of the front cover is a lantern (a light bulb oil lamp from Togo, so identified on the inside back cover); seven lines of introductory text in small, bold, sans serif type complete the design. \r\n\r\nThe design of the inside front cover and facing page features a photograph of a man's arm, posed horizontally and extending from the left edge of the inside front cover to the center of the right hand page. On a background of blue sky and clouds, the image shows the outer surface of the arm, beginning just below the elbow and sporting one of the M&Co Labs black wristwatches; the fingers of the hand are curled under. The left hand margin of the accompanying top-to-bottom text on the right hand page is curved. Cheers from M&Co in italics concludes the text. \r\n\r\nThe inside back cover provides several paragraphs regarding designers' collaboration, as well as product warranties and trademarks.",
