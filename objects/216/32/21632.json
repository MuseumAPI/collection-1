  "description": "Vertical rectangle. In auricular style. Shown in profile. The uppermost part of the design is lacking. The handle consists of a merman and, seemingly, a mermaid leaning backwards toward him. Two panels with reliefs depicting children are shown on the left and right of the ewer's body. The shape of the relief on the left side of the ewer forms mimics the shape of a mouth. The shaft consists of a kneeling merman supporting the body like an Atlas.",
