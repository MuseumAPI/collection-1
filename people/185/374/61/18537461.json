    "biography": "Taking over from Pierre-Dominique Maire, the prominent \u2018N\u00e9cessaire de Voyage\u2019 manufacturer, the company of Aucoc was started by Jean-Baptiste Casimir Aucoc in 1821. Based at 154 Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, Casimir worked primarily a silversmith, his specialty also being in the manufacture of \u2018N\u00e9cessaire de Voyage\u2019 dressing and travelling cases. His reputation for fine work gained him the appointment to King Charles X. In 1835, he moved the business to 4 & 6 Rue de la Paix in Paris, expanding into goldsmithing. Around 1850, he was joined in business by his son, Louis, and by 1854, Louis was running the business after Casimir\u2019s retirement that same year. On the birth of Louis\u2019 son (also called Louis) in 1850, Louis (the father) was then referred to as Louis Ain\u00e9 (the elder).\nLouis Aucoc Ain\u00e9 kept up the great tradition of manufacturing and retailing N\u00e9cessaires, whilst also expanding further into the production of decorative jeweler. By this time, the business had acquired appointments to King Louis-Philippe I and then Napoleon III, as well as other members of the royal family. It was during the mid 1870\u2032s, that Louis\u2019 son took over the helm of the business. In 1876, a sixteen year old Rene Lalique was given an apprenticeship by Louis Aucoc, which was to last two years. On the purchase of the Parisian jewellery business of Lobjois in 1877, Louis renamed the family business to La Maison Aucoc. In 1900, Louis\u2019s younger brother, Andr\u00e9, was in control of the business, returning it to its roots by focusing again on silversmithing.",
