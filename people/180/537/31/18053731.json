    "biography": "Italian electronics company Brionvega was founded in Milan in 1945 by the entrepreneur Giuseppe Brion and his friend and engineer Leone Pajetta under the appellation B.P.M. Originally established to manufacture electronic components, the company changed its name to Brionvega in 1960 and that same decade issued portable televisions designed by Marco Zanuso and Richard Sapper (the Doney and the Algol, respectively) as well as the iconic Cubo radio, a collaboration between the two.\n\nIn 1993, Gian Mario Rossignolo purchased Brionvega from the Brion family and incorporated the brand into hiscompany S\u00e8leco, which declared bankruptcy in 1997. The Brionvega brand, however, made a comeback in the twenty-first century; Sim2 Multimedia bought production rights to its radios and audio systems in 2004 and Super\/\/fluo purchased the right to the Brionvega brand as well as its TV designs and production rights in 2006, reissuing the Doney and Algol televisions and producing a new design under the Brionvega moniker.",
