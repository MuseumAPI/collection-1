    "description": "Horizontal rectangle. Designs for three altar candlesticks for a church of Jesuits. Intended  to be executed in gilded metal and blue and green marble. All have below pairs of lions upon a base. Those in the left design sit upon their hind legs and lean against a tower which has a tree in front. Those in the center sit beside a tree, raised up on their front legs. Those at right sit upon their hind legs and hold a festoon in front of a closed tower. The tree is up on the tower. Above these feet are spheres with the monogram of Jesus over three nails. At left: two angels with instruments of the Passion in their outside hands, kneel upon clouds and carry a conical shaft of a round pedestal, upon which a bowl stands with the socket. Festoons and cherubim decorate the pedestal. Center: the angels kneel upon clouds beside the tower and raise a column with a variation of the uppermost motif, at left. At right: the angels sit upon clouds and raise with their inside hands the shaft of a column. Another variation of the top motif is above.",
