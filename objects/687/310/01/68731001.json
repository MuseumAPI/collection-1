    "justification": "IBM\u2019s Selectric typewriter represents a revolution in typing technology, improving the speed and flexibility of business and personal writing. After its introduction in 1961, the Selectric went on to dominate the typewriter market nearly without peer for 25 years until it was eclipsed by the advent of more compact and functional computers. The particularly revolutionary aspect of the Selectric typewriter is its golf ball-shaped metal typing element. It eliminated the need for individual type bars that caused jamming and frustration in older typewriter models. Instead, the circular device, covered with typographical characters, pivots to place the correct character on the paper while the carriage remains stationary. The typing element is also interchangeable, allowing for an unprecedented selection of fonts and sizes. \nThe removal of the traditional shifting paper carriage from Selectric models presented Eliot Noyes with the opportunity to completely alter the appearance of the typewriter with an entirely new silhouette. The original Selectric, the first in a series of three models, has over 2,800 parts and was designed to be compact and comfortable while retaining a modern sculptural contour that Noyes drew from Italian Olivetti typewriters. The design and manufacturing processes took seven years to complete. While the Selectric typewriter is known for being a twentieth-century office fixture, its legacy goes far beyond the confines of typing alone. In 1964, IBM introduced the Magnetic Tape Selectric typewriter which included a device for storing characters, making the Selectric the first word processing device, a precursor and influence for future computer-based models. A modified version of the Selectric was also one of the first computer terminals, serving as the keyboard for the IBM System\/360 computer in the 1960s.&amp;nbsp; ",
