A broad rosy-red stripe at left has a large-scale Arabic inscription in yellow (the fabric must be turned 90 degrees in order to read the Islamic inscription). The central white stripe has geometric knot-like design in red (so badly worn that design is almost indistinguishable); the dark blue stripe on the right has arabesques in yellow and red.  Narrow white, green, and orange-red stripes border the wider stripes described above.  No selvedge present.",
