    "biography": "Virginia Restemeyer earned a BFA from the College of Mt. St. Joseph, Cincinnati, OH, and an MFA from Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. She started her career as a woodcarver. Then she turned to creating one-of-a-kind lamps, assemblages or sculptures. Using everyday objects liked discarded 1950s kitchen products and old vases to assemble her sculptures, Restemeyer says she pokes fun at women\u2019s previous household role. By giving the objects a new function and a new importance, she transforms old feminine symbols into objects with new roles.",
