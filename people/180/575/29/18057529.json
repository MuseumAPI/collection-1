    "biography": "Roy McMakin is known primarily as a furniture designer, and founder of the Seattle-based firm Domestic Furniture which he opened in Los Angeles in 1987.  Born in Wyoming in 1956, McMakin trained as an artist at the University of California, San Diego, where he was granted an MFA.  His furniture has been called \"hybrid\" in the sense that the forms, whether case or seating furniture, are clean, simple and unembellished, evoking earlier styles, from Shaker to Arts and Crafts to Modern.  However, McMakin combines their elements and proportions in an ambiguous way, provoking the user to think about aesthetic sensibilities, style and their own recollections of style.  McMakin came to prominence when the Getty Center chose to furnish their administrative offices with his designs.",
