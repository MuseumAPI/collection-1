    "description":"Panel in shades of orange and yellow with random splashes of green moving diagonally across the face of the textile. Warp fringe on both ends with vertical ribs at regular intervals.",
    "justification":"In this particular textile, Tomita employs a warp kasuri where only the warp threads have been bound and dyed. After these steps, he splashes dye on the warp threads and then beings the weaving process. As Tomita weaves, a blurring occurs at the junction of different colors, creating subtleties of colors within colors and a pattern that permanently captures the creative process. The use of multiple colors and tonal variations create a soft-focus effect and evoke a sense of calmness as well as the artist\u2019s source of inspiration, nature. \n&amp;nbsp;\nKasuri, the Japanese word for ikat, which is derived from the Malay-Indonesian word mengikat meaning \u201cto tie or to bind\u201d, has been popular in Japan since the 17th century. Ikat however, was established much earlier, and was used only in very special circumstances on clothing worn mainly by the aristocracy. ",
