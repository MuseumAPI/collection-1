Small scrapers and awls; sinew, fiber, and scraps of yarn to sew with; and needle cases and other small objects would have been found in this personal container (gungasvik).\nYup\u2019ik men made the chests, each one unique. This well-crafted box has a solid top and base, with an oval body that was formed by boiling and bending a narrow lath of wood. The walrus-ivory handle and inlays are incised with concentric circles, a Yup\u2019ik design that symbolizes levels of the cosmos. The container\u2019s other function\u2014as a heavily used cutting board\u2014is revealed by the numerous scratches on the bottom. The chest\u2019s owner simply turned the box over to cut pieces of skin or sinew for sewing.",
