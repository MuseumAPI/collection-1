    "justification":"\nThe fun and whimsical form of Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s SPUN chair, designed for Herman Miller Inc. in 2010, was inspired by Heatherwick\u2019s interest in the process of metal spinning. Heatherwick wondered: if it was possible to make drums out of spun metal, was it possible then to make a chair with a completely symmetrical rotational form that was comfortable to sit in as well? He developed the design for a chair that could rotate and be fully functional at all angles. Originally working with the London gallery, Haunch of Venison, Heatherwick had the design produced in highly polished metals. While collaborating with Italian furniture maker, Magis, Heatherwick decided to use rotationally molded plastic instead of metal for the chair design and SPUN was born. Resembling a spinning top more than a chair, SPUN is a creative and entertaining take on the art of sitting. This piece of industrial design rendered in a material durable enough for indoor or outdoor use, shows that functional objects can be fun and pieces of art in their own right. The form invites the sitter to spin and move, so the act of sitting is no longer passive. Even when lounging in the bowl-shaped seat of the chair, the sitter must experiment and adjust&amp;nbsp;to find a point of balance&amp;nbsp;that keeps the chair at rest. The SPUN chair is as conceptual as it is functional.",
