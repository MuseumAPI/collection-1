    "justification": "Since its founding by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft has been recognized as an innovator in the field of computer software and operating systems, and more recently in areas ranging from digital services to consumer electronics. Microsoft\u2019s wireless Arc Touch mouse is a product of the in-house design studio that creates the company's keyboards and mice. \nAt this point in the history of personal computing, we are all familiar with the mouse, a pointing device used to perform operations on the computer screen, that has become as integral to computing as the keyboard. For years, the predominant mouse design has consisted of a unit held under the user\u2019s hand, with one or more buttons and a wheel to control the cursor and other elements on the screen. More recent designs utilize touch sensitive surfaces in place of buttons and wheels.\nPortability has also become desirable. People are increasingly using mobile computers, requiring that their devices and peripherals provide reliability, comfort, and convenience during use or when packed for travel. The Arc Touch Mouse was designed with these user demands in mind. The lower portion of its body is jointed and flexible, containing over 90 parts, allowing it to be stored flat in a bag or pocket for travel, then bent into a curve to fit the hand when in use. The minimal, ergonomic design includes large flat buttons, and instead of a scroll wheel, which would take up volume, it employs a simple flat metal touch strip that mimics a scroll bar. The jointed section is covered in a skin-like silicone sleeve making it comfortable and highly gripable. The designers built over 60 prototypes to find the form best suited for both the bent or flattened positions.&amp;nbsp; With energy conservation in mind, they also devised a way to preserve battery life\u2014 when in the flat travel position, the Arc Touch is off; it automatically goes on when curved for use.&amp;nbsp; The small transceiver that connects the wireless Arc Touch to a computer can travel with it, magnetically held in place on the mouse\u2019s underside to prevent loss.",
