In the lateral panels is a niche with a standing female figure, and a circular pediment above, above which is a trophy. Projecting pillar strips correspond at the attic to the columns. Figures stand in front of them. A relief is in the panel of the lateral parts; an inscription in that of the central part. It has a circular pediment, and tow figures sitting with an escutcheon. The left part is the plan and at right the scale.",
