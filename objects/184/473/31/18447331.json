    "description": "On a peach-colored gradient ground, a green and grey kiosk. Above in black and peach: AMERICAN AIRLINES; below, in blue: TO \/ EUROPE. Turret is covered with posters that read: LONDON \/ HOLLAND \/ DENMARK \/ SWEDEN \/ NORWAY \/ ENGLAND \/ ICELAND \/ SCOTLAND \/ FINLAND GERMANY \/ IRELAND \/ PARIS [AA logo].\nBelow, in two blocks of black text: \u201cFor the person who visits Europe, the posters \/ displayed on the Kiosks there give him informa- \/ tion about theatres, concerts, aperitifs, patent \/ medicines, etc. To the traveler, it is one of the \/ most characteristic objects that he sees upon en- \/ tering large European cities. These cylinders of \/ information therefore become a symbol of the \/ life of the city, and being cylinder, it is from the \/ point of view of design a strong and commanding \/ form \u2013 a column of interest. The various colors of \/ the posters and different typographical arrange- \/ ments are often so accidentally placed in juxta- \/ position that from a distance the effect of the \/ pattern is not unlike \u201cmodern\u201d design. \/ \u201cchose this therefore as a symbol because of \/ its commanding simplicity of form \u2013 its gaiety to \/ the eye and its very definite association with \/ Europe. There is nothing intricate in the struc- \/ ture of the design \u2013 nor need there be. Only on \/ the surface of the Kiosk is introduced color and \/ shape.\u201d \/ E. McKNIGHT KAUFFER.",
