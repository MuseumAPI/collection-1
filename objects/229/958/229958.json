  "description": "Inspired by artist-travelers and their evocations of the harem, the smoking room, here a kiosk in the Moorish style, was designed to stimulate the five senses:  sight and touch, through color, tiles, sumptuous upholstery, exotic lanterns, mirrored panels, and patterned marble floors; smell, through the aroma of tobacco; sound, through music or a water fountain; and taste, through exotic delicacies. All combined to  create the mystical environment of the smoking room. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
