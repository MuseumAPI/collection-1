Overlaid midway is a cut-out of a black-and-orange fan-shaped diagram of piano keys, music notation, the printed words \"SUN\", and two cut-outs in place of the man's eyes, transforming them into slits. At three-quarters, lower left, is an image of a train, from a newspaper or book, appearing to run into the young man's mouth, which is colored lipstick-red. At the top is the inscription \"MYSTERY TRAIN\", followed by a listing of the credits for the making of this film.",
