  "description": "As a working copy, this object shows the development of the Chiat/Day self promotion project, Scientific Literature Dealing with the Problems of Dreams. (See 1993-151-418.) The case, exterior covered in red fabric and originally used for a purpose unrelated to this project, is designed to simulate a book. Page one, recto, is headed Chapter I, The Scientific Literature Dealing with the Problems of Dreams, followed by text, which continues on the verso. Page three, mounted on cardboard which on the outside gives the appearance of actual pages, continues the text, which is interrupted by incisions on the inside to hold two booklets, a videocassette and case and a desk sign. The cover page of one booklet depicts mountains and clouds in black and white, on which The media is the message is superimposed. The white cover page of the second booklet shows a suggestion of a mountain in black in the lower left-hand corner and is imprinted What is this thing called account planning? The interior pages of both booklets are blank. The empty videocassette case has an account ledger background design and is imprinted in the upper quarter Chiat Day Mojo on one line and case by case in the line below.",
