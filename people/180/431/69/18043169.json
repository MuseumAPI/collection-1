    "biography": "The Guerrilla Girls are a group of anonymous female artists\u2014known for wearing gorilla masks\u2014formed in 1985 in New York City. The group\u2019s goal was to use art and performance as a tool to protest sexual and racial inequalities. They were formed as a reaction to MoMA\u2019s 1985 exhibition, \u201cAn International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture,\u201d featuring 169 artists, only thirteen of which were women. The Guerrilla Girls responded by staging a protest outside the museum. When little attention followed, they produced a poster campaign in SoHo and the East Village.",
