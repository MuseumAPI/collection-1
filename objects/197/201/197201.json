  "description": "On glossy cardboard, the white background, comprising about three-quarters of the object, is divided from the gray by a thin, navy blue horizontal line. In the upper left hand corner, a blue letter M is imprinted in sans-serif type and encircled, also in blue. M&Co is directly underneath; Serving the Nation, in quotes, is just above the line slightly to the right of M&Co; and underneath the line, the address and telephone number are imprinted on three lines. Completing the design is a three-quarter profile head shot of Tibor Kalman, dressed in suit and tie, facing left,  superimposed on a map of the United States.",
