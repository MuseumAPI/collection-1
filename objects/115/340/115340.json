  "description": "In the present head-and-shoulders frontal view, occupying three-quarters of the page top-to-bottom and extending fully side-to-side, a man glances to the left, apparently engaged in thought. The furrowed brow; chin resting on the left hand, which terminates the arm extending from the lower edge of the page; and the pen grasped by that same hand support this interpretation. Publ[ius]/ Ovid[ius]/ Naso, imprinted in capitals above the right shoulder, confirms that the subject is a man of letters, the Roman poet, Ovid.\r\n\r\nIn the lower right-hand corner is a partial view of the right profile of a man.",
