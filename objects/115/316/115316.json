  "description": "This head-and-shoulders view of a female in right profile is a design for a greeting card. The line drawing, lacking shading, emphasizes the sculptural quality of the facial features: the eye sockets are blank, the cheekbone incised by two intersecting curved lines. The hair is styled in a wave next to the face and over the ear, and then pulled at the back of the neck into a chignon. The whole is enclosed within a thin rectangular border, and just above the bottom line of the border Greetings from Gustav Jensen is imprinted in small Art Deco style capitals.",
