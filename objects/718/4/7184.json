  "description": "A shield back side chair with a splat composed of three open blade-forms; cusped on their interiors and separated under the top rail by two blossoms.  The forms merge into a fluted spreading panel at their base.  Its legs are straight, square, and tapered in the front on square feet.  The seat is shaped, hollowed, and upholstered in black-painted canvas (possibly the original upholstery).",
