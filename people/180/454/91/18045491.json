    "biography": "Robert Haussmann studied at The School of Applied Arts in Zurich. He trained under several renowned Bauhaus architects including Johannes Itten, Gerrit Rietveld, and Willy Guhl before founding his own architectural office in 1956. Trix Haussmann studied at the ETH in Zurich under Valerio Olgiati and Ernst Gisel. Trained within the modernist cannon and their work took on an anti-classical mannerism. The couple approached design with the intent to reinterpret traditional ornamental style. Their techniques focused on illusion, distortion, reflection and play with scale. The couple referred to their approach as Manerismo Critico; looking at past traditions, pursuing their further development, and providing a new interpretation with a touch of humor. \n\nTrix and Robert Haussmann began their collaboration in 1967 designing chairs. In 1981 they founded their own company, The General Design Institute. One of the couples most acclaimed design projects was the redesign of Zurich\u2019s main station in the Galleria Hamburg. In 1988 Knoll introduced a lounge seating collection designed by the couple for which they received great acclaim.",
