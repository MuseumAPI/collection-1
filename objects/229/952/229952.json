  "description": "This bedroom-boudoir suggests a room for receiving, sewing, writing, gossiping and sleeping. The tall, narrow room is set with a curtained bed alcove at one end. The walls are densely hung with pictures. A gold-and-black lacquer cabinet, a desk, and a casual arrangement of a table laden with books and sewing basket emphasize the informal character of the room. A colorful floral carpet in red and green tones covers the entire floor.",
