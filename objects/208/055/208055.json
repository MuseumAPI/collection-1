  "description": "The poster is divided into two portions. The upper section (occupying two thirds of the total design) shows an enlarged photomechanical reproduction of a woman (printed in blue) against a yellow background.  The woman is presented in three-quarter length profile (at right side, facing left) and she holds a tea tray with a teapot, cup and saucer, creamer and bowl with cubed sugar. She is dressed in an apron over a short sleeved conservative cut blouse. Wearing earrings and smiling, she typifies the traditional sterotype of the 1950s homemaker.    The text is printed vertically along upper left side of the poster: Some words are in blue (and mostly read vertically); some words are in red (and are printed horizontally).  This vertical line of words is integral to the design, and they suggest a personage being addressed by the woman.  At the upper left are the words: The Public Theater.  The bottom section of the poster is printed in red, and it shows the title of the play \"WASP\" in large white letters, which cast a blue shadow on a red background. Beneath this main title is a second line of text (the subtitle?), printed in blue.",
