    "justification": "This model exhibits a combination for the use of ivory, characteristic of much of the decorative arts of Venice, and the form of a Venetian palazzo.&amp;nbsp; While not yet identified, it is very similar to the Palazzo Mocenigo,a&amp;nbsp;dominantly seventeenth-century Gothic-style palace, and similar to several others on the Grand Canal.&amp;nbsp; Ivory came to Venice through trade and their Byzantine era connections with the Middle East.&amp;nbsp; Early objects were treasured much like gemstones,&amp;nbsp;while later, ivory was worked into furniture, placques and commemorative carvings.&amp;nbsp; This model shows an attention to the minutest architectural details such as window pediments, rustication of the pilasters, and the doors at the bottom level that would give out onto the canal for the gondolas.&amp;nbsp; It is a synthesis of skillful use of ivory and the representation of a palazzo as an adored object.",
