His career as a graphic designer began in 1966 after he worked in Aba, Nigeria with the Peace Corps at a trade school for girls.  While attempting to find a skill to teach the students that would be valuable in their daily life, he learned to screen print.  This foray into artistic practice blossomed upon Frykholm's return to the United States and he recieved his MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfied Hills, Michigan.\n\nFrykholm began his design career shortly after graduating, when he was hired as the first in-house graphic designer at Herman Miller, Inc. and was tasked with designing the poster for the company's annual picnic.  Some 47 years later, Frykholm serves as the Vice President of Creative Design at the famed furniture company.  He has been the recipient of numerous awards, including graphic design and communications awards from the AIGA, the New York Art Directors Club, and Americn Center for Design, Communication Arts, Graphics, and Print.
