    "description":"Groups of three narrow stripes and a broad stripe alternate above a dado and beneath an entablature, the bottom molding of which is colored green. The lower part of the design suggests waved bands for the stripes, except the central one of the narrow ones, showing ovoidals. Strokes shadow the backgrounds. In the upper part are suggested: a frieze motif for the broad stripes, a waved band with halves of rosettes in the wedges for the narrow stripes, framing the broad one, palmettes for the central narrow stripe. A garland of vine leaves and hanging blossoms is laid over the tops of the stripes. Framing similar to 1940-120-9.",
