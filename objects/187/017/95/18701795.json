    "description":"White linen tassel with two balls (of different sizes) connected into a barbell-shape forming the base. Core is braided over with linen yarns worked in groups of four yarns at the top and more at the bottom for a basket-weave effect. From the base protrude a few knotted elements and from bottom of core hang four separate braided and knotted elements. Two of these elements are smaller braided ball bases hanging from braided stem with further braided and knotted elements ending in tiny braided balls hanging from them. The remaining two are shorter, braided, pear-shaped elements covered in knotted protrusions.",
