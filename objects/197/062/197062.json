Meet, in large black capital letters, is superimposed on the steak and fills three-quarters  of the space in the upper half. At Florent 24 hours, continuing the sentence begun above, is imprinted in small black capitals in the right half, close to the bottom edge. \r\nVerso: The message (left) and addressee (right) spaces are divided by a thin black line. At the top left is the restaurant name, address and related information on four lines in black upper and lower case letters. At the top right, the stamp area is outlined in dashes, and an image of a potato occupies most of the space where a stamp would go. Post Card is underneath and to the right of the dividing line, followed by three horizontal lines for addressee information.\r\n",
