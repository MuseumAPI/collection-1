  "description": "A design for a decorative panel with vertical composition.  From the bottom up: a ram's head supports an elaborate pedestal upon which sit two girls.  They carry children on their shoulders.  The children, standing, fasten festoons to bars, which are projecting laterally from an octagonal frame.  At the center of the frame is a representation of a sitting woman and child.  This is the central motif on the entire panel.  Above, a half figure of a winged girl stands upon the frame.  She carries upon her head a basket with long tree branches and vegetal scrolls.  The composition is inscribed within a frame.",
