  "description": "The present view shows a female with a square chin; almost-closed eyes under straight brows; straight nose, turned slightly upward at the tip; and full, closed lips. The center-parted hair cascades in ringlets on either side of the forehead and next to the face, stopping just below chin level. The configuration of the eyes and accompanying shading convey a sleepy expression.",
