    "biography": "Koons began working with his father, who owned a printing business, at an early age, practicing design by creating greeting cards and posters.  During his teenage years he continued to assist his father with client projects.  This early interest in design provided a good foundation for his undergraduate training at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.  He has worked as an illustrator and graphic designer, creating business and brand identities as well.  His archives are located at the Hagley Museum, Delaware, and other examples of his artwork are in the collection of Yeshiva University Museum.",
