    "biography": "Michael Anastassiades\u2019s work epitomizes pure form. He reduces a concept to its core, creating uncluttered, elegant, and timeless objects that remain imbued with a signature expressiveness. Anastassiades\u2019s work pairs simple form with luxury finishes and meticulous detailing, the precariousness of many pieces enabled by intricate engineering. Anastassiades studied civil engineering at London\u2019s Imperial College before obtaining a master\u2019s degree in industrial design from the Royal College of Art. He established his London-based studio in 1994 and, in 2007, launched Michael Anastassiades Ltd., overseeing all development, production, and distribution of his pieces.",
