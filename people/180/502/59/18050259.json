    "biography": "Margarete H. L. Marks was a German ceramicist, who was active in both Germany and London. She studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Cologne, Germany and the Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf. From 1920\u201421 she trained at the Bauhaus in Weimar. Her work emphasizes simple modern shapes and abstraction. In 1923 she founded the Ha\u00ebl Werkst\u00e4tten factory at Marwitz with her first husband, Gustav Loebenstein and his brother Daniel Loebenstein. By 1933, she was forced to close and sell the Ha\u00ebl Werkst\u00e4tten factory and leave Germany due to her Jewish ancestry. She relocated to Britain in 1935 and designed modernistic tableware for Minton in Stoke-on-Trent from 1936\u201439. In 1939 she opened her own workshop, Greta Pottery. After WWII, she worked in her own pottery workshop. Marks was never commercially successful with her abstract designs, especially later in life. In 2012, the Milwaukee Art Museum curated the first show devoted to her life and work with the assistance of her daughter.",
