    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;W. A. S. Benson was trained as an architect, but took up metalwork at the suggestion of Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. A leader of the British Arts and Crafts movement, Benson's light fittings became models for other Arts and Crafts metalwork: innovative lighting designs for both candles and electric light: innovative lighting designs for both candles and electric light. \nEarly in his career, Benson focused predominantly on hand-crafted objects and candle lighting. In 1881, he hired the brass and copper-worker John Lovegrove, with whom he worked for many years, relying on his experience and skill. In 1884 he was a founding member of the Art Worker's Guild, which brought together progressive architects, designers and craftsmen. And in 1887 Benson helped set up the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society to address the lack of exhibitions for decorative art, an area not covered by The Royal Academy. \nBenson's workshop succeeded in mixing hand and machine production by maintaining honesty of construction and quality of workmanship and design. Many of his electric lamp designs are based on an assembly of standard parts used in different ways depending on the function, demonstrating a fascination with machinery in both the designs and production methods. Benson was also a capable engineer. His use of modern machinery combined with his Arts and Crafts passion for the handmade can be seen in many of his electric lamp designs. The decorative style of the copper and brass decoration forming plant leaves, and the use of opalescent glass for the globe show Benson's continued interest in artistry while promoting new technology. \nInitially, the introduction of electric lighting into British society was limited to the upper classes. By the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, cheaper and more reliable electrical distribution brought electricity to a broader range of society. Since Benson was a noteworthy engineer and innovative designer, his electrical lamps featured high quality construction and design, thus, not surprisingly being held in high esteem by both upper and middle class consumers.&quot;",
