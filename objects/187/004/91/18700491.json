    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;This is a good example of the use of enamel in Faberg\u00e9 jewelry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This piece is marked by&amp;nbsp; Faberge&amp;nbsp; workmaster August Fredrick Hollming ( 1854-1913.&amp;nbsp; Hollming had the right to sign objects with his initials.&amp;nbsp; Born in Finland, he was a workmaster in St. Petersburg from 1880 until his death.&amp;nbsp; He produced gold and silver boxes, some enamelled and, occasionally, some enamelled jewelry, of which this is a fine example.&amp;nbsp; The quality of the central diamond is high,&amp;nbsp; which is appropriate.&amp;nbsp; This piece augments and compliments Faberg\u00e9 gold iris pendant (1995-15-6), enamel pendant egg (1995-15-2), and gold and jeweled brooch (1995-15-5) in collection.&amp;nbsp; The shape of the pendant relates closely to recently discovered and published drawings from the St. Petersburg Archives.&amp;nbsp; The enamelled back centered by a diamond and surrounded by a band of small band of diamonds is similar to that of a well-exhibited and published watchcase produced by Faberge during the same period.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This piece demonstrates high quality use of engine-turning under enamel, relating to the techniques of snuffboxes produced in Switzerland and France in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&quot;",
