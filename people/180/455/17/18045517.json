    "biography":"Mark Pollack studied weaving at the Rhode Island School of Design, and still continues to study the RISD collection of historic textiles to create unexpected interpretations. After graduating in 1976, he served eleven years as the associate design director of Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., before founding his own company, The Pollack Studios, eighteen years ago. Pollack is well known for his sophisticated, meticulously crafted fabrics. He is a relentless experimenter who truly respects the technology and craft of textiles. The inspiration for his fabrics comes from the material and construction of the fabric itself as well as the process of creating the fabric. Having started in contract textiles before developing lines for residential interiors, his textiles combine rigorous material engineering with a highly developed aesthetic. Many of them are technical marvels.",
