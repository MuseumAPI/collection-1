Lined with red-orange silk with gray silk crepe inside bottom and halfway up the opening. Edges faced with stencil-patterned silk. Hem and sleeves padded with unspun silk. \nThe four red fabrics are pattern-dyed using teh itajime process, in which a folded fabric is pressed between boards, the two faces of which are carved with the same pattern. Holes in the board allow for the passage of dye.",
