Between discs are oval plaques some of which have a geometric pattern and others fine leaf sprays. These motifs form a frame for two alternating scenes. One depicts two Chinese men in conversation beside a rustic pavilion. The other scene shows a peacock beside a garden wall with an urn at the end. Original paper was found as a book cover of Court Records of Southampton County in Courtland, Virginia. Design is later part of 18th century.
