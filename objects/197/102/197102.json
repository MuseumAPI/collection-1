  "description": "An illustration of a cutaway view of a human stomach is centered on the page. Thin\r\nstraight lines, extending from various parts of the stomach, end in eight food labels in miniature black sans serif type: for example, creme caramel, escargots, and coffee. Restaurant Florent, in larger, yet small, capitals, is centered above, and the address, telephone and hours of business are centered below. A thin-lined rectangle surrounds the whole.",
