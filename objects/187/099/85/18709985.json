    "justification": "Designed for the Norman bar (part of bar and restaurant), Leeds, England. Variation of Dixon's &quot;Jack&quot; chair.&amp;nbsp; A self-taught designer, Dixon first came to international attention for his do-it-yourself approach, particularly in his welded metal forms . By the mid-1990s Dixon had an established design practice, and was starting to explore plastics. He founded the firm Eurolounge to produce his own designs, and utilized the rotary molding technque to produce durable polyethylene forms, including the &quot;Jack&quot; light and chair. The stool seen here uses the basic form of the cylinder for the shaft of the seat as well as the tripod base. The form is surprisingly stable, and images of the Norman Bar show the stool used upright, or turned upside down to serve as a tray rest or seat.\nCHNDM has an example Dixon's &quot;S&quot; chair of welded tubular steel and recycled inner tubes from 1988.&amp;nbsp; The addition of the stool to the collection shows another facet of Dixon's development in his early career. By 1998 he was appointed Head of Design by the British retailer Habitat, and in 2004, he became creative director of Artek, the firm founded by Alvar Aalto in 1935. He is known for combining the creative with the commercial.",
