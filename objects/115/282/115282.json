  "description": "A straight, vertical line; pointed nose; full, closed lips and rounded chin comprise the profile outline. The line of the eyebrow curves downward, then upward into a mass of abstract curlicues forming a full head of shoulder-length hair. The head and neck sit on broad, rounded shoulders, turning left in a frontal view. An off-the-shoulder, ruffled neckline completes the design.",
