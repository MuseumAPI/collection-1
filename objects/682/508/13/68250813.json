    "justification": "\nWhen Scholten &amp; Baijings were asked to develop some textiles for Maharam, their only requirements were to work with color and geometric compositions. The results\u2014Bocks &amp; Grid\u2014to be introduced in June 2015, are studies in line and color which bring to mind the de Stijl artist, Piet Mondrian and his counterpart in design, Gerrit Rietveld. Avoiding primary colors, however, Scholten&amp;Baijings opt for more subtle tones, which they find appropriate for upholstery fabric. \nThe eight samples show some of the developmental stages of these two fabrics. Starting with handmade samples from the studio to woven color blankets made at the TextielMuseum in Tilburg, the samples&amp;nbsp;reveal the importance of handcraft and industrial processes in the designers\u2019 works. As Stefan Scholten said &quot;this going back and forth between making tests and then reworking the design in our workshop is a long and intensive process, enabling us to really get to know and use the technical competence of a producer [Maharam and the mill] in an optimal way.&quot;",
