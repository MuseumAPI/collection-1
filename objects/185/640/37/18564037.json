The field contains three alphabets, a set of numerals, a verse and inscription.  At the bottom, a view delicately rendered in embroidery and watercolor of the Charlestown Neck House. On three sides, a deep border of rose garlands caught up with bows of blue ribbon at the upper corners.\n\nThe verse reads: \nA Morning in Spring\nLo! the bright the rosy morning\nCalls me forth to take the air\nCheerful spring with smiles returning\nUshers in the new-born year\n\nPraise to thee thou great creator\nPraise be thine from ev'ry tongue\nJoin my soul with evry creature\nJoin the univeral song\n\nWrought by Lucy D Stickney Charlestown November 16 1830  Aged 12",
