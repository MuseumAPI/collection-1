  "description": "This library interior is a prime example of Gothic Revival vocabulary. The room is dominated by the ceiling decoration of intertwining arches. French doors are designed with pointed arches, a cross and an overdoor molding of broken arches. A chimney and mirror, flanked by large sculptures on plinths, are at right center. The bookcases terminate in an egg and dart molding.",
