  "description": "White political poster with black text. Text reads: \r\n\"THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING A WOMAN ARTIST:/ Working without the pressure of success./ Not having to be in shows with men./ Having an escape from the art world in your 4 free-lance jobs./ Knowing your career might pick up after you're eighty./ Being reassured that whatever kind of art you make it will be labeled feminine./ Not being stuck in a tenured teaching position./ Seeing your ideas live on in the works of others./ Having the opportunity to choose between a career and motherhood./ Not having to choke on those big cigars or paint in Italian suits./ Having more time to work after your mate dumps you for someone younger./ Being included in revised versions of art history./ Not having to undergo the embarassment of being called a genius./ Getting your pictures in the art magazines wearing a gorilla suit./ Please send $ and comments to: Guerilla Girls Conscience of the Art World/ Box 1056 Cooper Sta. NY, NY 10276.\"\r\n",
