    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Austrian designer and painter Koloman Moser was born in Vienna and became one of the leading designers of the early 20th century.&amp;nbsp; He worked in a variety of media, including glass, silver and textiles, to create works ranging from postage stamps to stained glass. Moser was one of the founders of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (May 1903), but left the group in 1907 to focus on his own work.&amp;nbsp; Though his years at the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte were short-lived, he had a great effect on this group.&amp;nbsp; He most likely designed the famous WW monogram, whose typography shows similarities to the one created and used by the British Arts and Crafts Movement designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh.The box is constructed of sheets of silver-plated brass. Also on the base are five stamped marks.&amp;nbsp; The Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte saw these marks as crucial representative symbols, as the most important signets and monograms already existed when the organization was founded.&amp;nbsp; Keeping with the concept of aesthetically significant marks for identification, the group designed several marks and the individual designers and makers contributed their own.&amp;nbsp; The first mark on the box is the Rose Mark (registered on June 22, 1903), which was created by Josef Hoffman, and is arguably the most commonly seen symbol on Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte silver.&amp;nbsp; The second mark is the WW monogram in an oval (used from 1903 to 1905), that identifies the piece as being produced within the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte; its form also shows the box to be one of their earlier pieces, as the inscribed oval was only used in the early stages.&amp;nbsp; The third and fourth marks are for Moser and incorporate his initials in different arrangements and shaped shields.&amp;nbsp; The fifth mark, the letter &quot;T&quot; enclosed in a larger &quot;Q,&quot; currently unidentified, is almost certainly the metalworker's maker's mark of the craftsman who actually executed the work.&amp;nbsp; The inclusion of this last mark is significant, as it demonstrates the recognition of the importance of both the designer and the metalworker together in the creation of a piece.&amp;nbsp; The marks are a clue to the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte's approach of recognizing of the role of design and execution over the value of the materials. The same amount of energy was expended in the design and execution for this silver-plated piece as was done for solid silver examples. The substantiation of this is in the presence of all the same marks a silver piece would have had, minus the silver standard mark.&quot;",
