    "biography": "Heidrun Schimmel has been working with textiles since 1958.  She studied both painting and textile design at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Nurnburg between 1960-65, but eventually focused on embroidery.  Since the late 1990s, her work has been exclusively stitching white cotton thread on black silk organza, often creating multiple layers of stitching which result in a beautifully deformed and curled textile.  She has exhibited internationally and is a recipient of a number of textile awards including the Joanne Purrington Folley Memorial Award at the 2004 Fiberart International (Pittsburgh, PA) and the1999 Milward Award for the most outstanding use of handstitchery in Art of the Stitch (London).",
