  "description": "On the bottom half of the front cover, the present object is enclosed in its original paper wrapper, bound by the spiral on the left and extending over the right edge and to the back, until it again meets the spiral. Text in black type, picking up somewhere in the middle of the narrative, and laid out parallel to the page length, begins on the wrapper recto and continues on the verso. In the lower half of the recto, the text is interrupted by the exhibition catalogue title, Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos, in large black sans serif type, the words placed unevenly. Lines of capital letters in beige-on-beige form the background; their content appears to be random, except for three lines appearing below the title, New Museum of Contemporary Art/ September 14-November 26, 1989/ Curated by Laura Trippi.\r\nUnlike the page sequence in the unwrapped catalogue, the cardboard covers are placed toward the center. The visible upper half of the first page behind the wrapper shows a fractal image, photographed by Richard K. Voss.",
