  "description": "The six discrete Morrell tongue label parts comprise three labels for canned tongue (see below). They share certain design elements: a navy blue background; large, white serif-style type for the product name; smaller gilt upper case type for details of the package contents; and images of plated sliced tongue, photographed in color. Some details vary: in the ox tongue version, the garnish is parsley, and unseen hands hold a knife in the act of slicing the tongue, thus adding to the already plated contents; in the lunch tongue version, a dark green leaf is accompanied by two radishes.\r\n\r\n1956-47-84-cc and 1956-47-84-ff comprise one label, imprinted Morrell/ ox/ tongue.\r\n1956-47-84-aa and 1956-47-84-ee comprise one label, imprinted Morrell/ lunch/ tongue.\r\n1956-47-84-bb and 1956-47-84-dd comprise one label, imprinted Morrell/ lunch/ tongue.\r\n\r\nAlbum, pages 4 and 5.",
