On this level is a pedestal base showing a relief, representing the death of a classical painter (?); the relief is flanked by the personifications of Architecture at left, and a woman holding a wreath at the right.  Above, a winged classical male nude (a genius figure), holding a wreath in his outstretched right hand, stands in front of the sarcophagus, which is supported by crouching lions.   The side of the sarcophagus is decorated with a relief showing a medallion portrait of a man, wearing a wig, above a festoon.  At the bottom of the sheet, at the lower left, is a rough sketch of a draped woman; to the right of lower center is a mourning woman leaning against the corner of a pedestal or sarcophagus.  On the verso is a fragment of a caption.",
