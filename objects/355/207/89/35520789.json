    "description":"Two registers. Upper register: a striped horizontal panel in black sits atop an orange rectangle, jutting diagonally, on a yellow square, also jutting diagonally, on the right of which is a half arc in yellow, and next to that is an aqua blue triangle; lower register: nearly identical form, but in place of the yellow square is a gray triangle, a yellow rectangle and a pink arc with a base.",
    "justification":"These two sheets of designs for tables turn out to be rather important as they date from the first year of Memphis, the highly influential design collective, led by Ettore Sottsass, and including Michele de Lucchi, Matteo Thun, Marco Zanini, and Nathalie du Pasquier among others.&amp;nbsp; This group, which coalesced in response to the predominant modernist aesthetic , caused a sensation with their fun product designs and architecture in flamboyant colors and richly patterned surfaces in contrast to the cool, elegance of modern design.&amp;nbsp; These designs explore some playful ideas for a table using, in contrast to a \u201cnormal\u201d base system, uses a leaning single column base buttressed by an arc shaped support stabilizing the table\u2019s support system.&amp;nbsp; The black and white striped table top can be found in other products De Lucchi designed for Memphis such as the Oceanic Table Lamp and Flamingo Side Table.&amp;nbsp; The base motif appears to have inspired the 1980s Tea Kettle design by Matteo Thun.",
