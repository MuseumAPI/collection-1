    "biography": "De Boer began her design training under Margaret Hildebrand at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg from 1957-1961. After completing her studies she joined Hildebrand working at the notable German manufacturer Stuttgarter Gardinenfabrik, established in 1934, which flourished in the 1950s as a confident and design-led producer of textiles. De Boer joined the company in 1962 and was appointed studio head in 1963, and then artistic director in 1975. De Boers\u2019 designs represent a confident abstraction that is at once rhythmically stimulating yet highly controlled.",
