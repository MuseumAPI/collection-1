Trained as an architect at the Berlin Poytechnic, Frankl moved to the United States in 1914, but returned to his native Austria briefly during World War I. He began as an architect, but switched to painting and furniture and product design, gaining notice for the skyscraper style furniture he introduced in the 1920s when he returned to New York and opened a design gallery. By 1934, Frankl moved his design business to Los Angeles, where he also taught. Despite the popularity of his modernist furniture designs, especially among Hollywood celebrities, he achieved his broadest impact through extensive writing on design, which shaped popular perceptions of the emerging modern styles of the 1930s and later.",
