    "description": "Poster for the outdoor exhibition, Works in the Open Air, at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art, Ansan (2010). \"Works in the open air\" appears in a staggered vertical composition. The words are printed in varying shades of blue, with different textures (lined, dotted, etc.). They are integrated into a larger composition of abstract designs (yellow and purple) and Hangul text (red), as if in layers. Beneath these layers, small human figures are lightly outlined against the white background. They are shown in various poses of relaxation and play.",
    "justification": "This striking poster was designed to promote an outdoor exhibition held at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art in Ansan in 2010.&amp;nbsp; The English language translation of the exhibition title is quite different from the literal translation of the Korean title, which means \u201cWhatever happened to the theme park.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Sulki &amp; Min were interested in incorporating the idea of porosity and transparency into their poster design, drawing on Modernist references: Gerd Arntz\u2019s human figures for the Isotype system are laid out across the background of the poster, while the letterforms are derived from Josef Albers.&amp;nbsp; Each element is treated with a graphic mind towards translucence, so that the buildup of layers maintains a sense of airy space evocative of the exhibition's theme.",
