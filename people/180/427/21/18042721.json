    "biography":"Ilonka Karasz was born in Hungary and trained at the Royal Academy of Arts and Crafts in Budapest.  After immigrating to the United States in 1913 she became an active member of the New York art scene.  There is evidence of her designing textiles and wallcoverings as early as 1915, but beginning in the late 1940s she designed wallcoverings exclusively for Katzenbach & Warren, Inc. She also designed furniture, metalwork, ceramics, textiles, murals. In the realm of graphic arts, Karasz created over 100 covers for the New Yorker magazine as well as book covers for several publishers.",
