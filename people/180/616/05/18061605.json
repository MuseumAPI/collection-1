    "biography": "Norman Bel Geddes was born in Michigan in 1893 and raised in New Philadelphia, Ohio. His creative career begins in theater design first  in Los Angeles in 1916, and later for the Metropolican Opera in New York in 1918. Bel Geddes, who is best known for his commerical and industrial designs, opened his own Industrial Design studio in 1927. Perhaps  most notable of Bel Geddes' career is his popularization of the streamlined aesthetic which is particular to American Art Deco. Bel Geddes applied this sleek, aerodynamic look to a variety of commercial forms from cars, trains, and planes to telephones, radios, and buildings.",
