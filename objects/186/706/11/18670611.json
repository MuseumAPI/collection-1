    "provenance": "In the fall of 1972, Henry Dreyfuss and Doris Marks Dreyfuss gave materials they had retained after their 1969 retirement from the firm to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum (they also endowed the Doris and Henry Dreyfuss Memorial Study Center, which is the Museum's library). Materials previously donated to CalTech, the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (largely Dreyfuss's early theatrical work), were transfered to the Museum in 1973. During this period, former clients were solicited for additional material, which goods are now firmly embedded in American consumer culture ands serve as models of the role that design played in everyday life.",

    "description": "The work of Henry Dreyfuss, constantly focused on the needs of the average consumer, had a profound impact on the daily lives of millions of Americans. His firm had hundreds of clients (American Airlines, A T & T, Deere & Company, Hallmark Cards Incorporated, Polaroid Corp.) and worked on thousands of items. The material included in this archive does not cover all clients and projects undertaken by Dreyfuss. This collection consists of theater design materials, industrial design materials, primarily, though not exclusively, from the 1950s and 60s, draft copies of his books, including extensive research files for the \"Symbol Soursebook\", texts of lectures delivered by Dreyfuss, and biographical material. Included is Dreyfuss's Brown Book which provides an outline of his achievements. Photographs and slides of many of his designs are included. Materials relating to three publications include original drafts of the books with author notes, drawings, photographs, correspondence, and research materials. Also contains materials relating to the symbols exhibition held at the Hallmark Gallery in New York City in 1972.\n311 reels of microfilm documenting most of the projects undertaken by Dreyfuss Associates were created by the firm and added to the collection later. \nMaterials are arranged into four record group:\n1) Biographical information;\n2) Theater design;\n3) Industrial design;\n4)Publications.",
