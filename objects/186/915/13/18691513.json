    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The S\u00e8vres manufactory continues to produce beautiful porcelain wares, but examples from the period immediately following the war are scarce. Occasionally they may be found in auction catalogues both here and abroad, but for the most part they remain in private or museum collections. The Mus\u00e9e National de C\u00e9ramique - S\u00e8vres has a number of examples in its holdings.\nThe form of this particular vase was designed by Maurice Gensoli in 1950. Gensoli was active in the manufactory's design department from approximately 1925 through the late 1950s. Less is known about Rabaey, but his whimsical and elegant decoration is very suggestive of the period. Much of French design in the early 1950s remained entrenched in a sensibility initially established in the 1940s, when high-style interiors and objects by Jacques Adnet, Gilbert Piollerat, Serge Roche,&amp;nbsp; Emilio Terry, Raymond Subes, Jean Roy\u00e8re, and Jean Cocteau, to name just a handful, were introduced to the market place. Evident in much of their work was an ample dose of the theatrical and the surreal, all of which bordered on an almost Mannerist tendency. Popular themes, often seen in stage design, window displays, table settings, and so forth, were Astrology, the Cosmos and the sea. The S\u00e8vres vase displays symbols that appear to be from the Greek Zodiac, and a seemingly Arabic-like calligraphy beneath. Its slightly metaphysical qualities are not unlike some of those seen in collaborations between Gio Ponti and Piero Fornasetti in Italy in the same period. Its illustrative features are also somewhat reminiscent of Raymond Loewy's &quot;Script&quot; patterned china for Rosenthal, also produced in the early 50s. As was always the case, works from S\u00e8vres were intended for a luxury market. Despite this, attempts were made to embrace modernism by manufacturing wares that displayed so-called modernist trends in design. This piece is suggestive of a very rich period in French design.&quot; ",
