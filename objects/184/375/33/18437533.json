Center area in dark maroon with vertical stripes of light blue and a bright red-brown. Ornamented on either end with intricate insets of cream color with horizontal bands of design, by making use of one additional warp. Wide borders in dark red, with a narrow stripe of dark blue on outer-most side and a stripe showing a geometric pattern in gold on the inner most side (touching the center panel), run the length of the piece on both sides of the center panel. Woven in three sections and fringed.",
