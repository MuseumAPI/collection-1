The lower story of the tower shows columns and pilasters of Ionic order. A painting hangs on the central wall. Statues of saints stand in niches in the obliquelydispersed lateral walls. The upper story has a dado with an escutcheon on the front. Steps rise on the dado with statues standing at the corners of the lowest one. The story has pilasters of Corinthian order at the corners. An ovoidal painting is at the central wall. On top is a pedestal with two virtues and with a painted representation referring to the saint. A statue of the Virgin with the Child stands on a column on the pedestal. Many brackets carry candles.",
