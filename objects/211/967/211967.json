  "description": "Four-pointed star shape formed from negative space left by series of two-sided lines, clustered into four groups. These groups contain four  bent lines embedded within each other, becoming smaller as they radiate outwards. Each line form is constructed of one thin and thick segment. TThese forms create larger four-pointed star shape that mimics the appearance of a folded ribbon. This form is confined within a green-bordered circle.",
