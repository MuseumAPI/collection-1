    "description": "Portfolio containing six designs for woven fabric wallcoverings. Each of the designs contains a large swatch with smaller swatches showing colorways underneath. Portfolio folds out in accordion style. The samples include Firenze, Panama, Mojave, Eton, Eton Square, and Chelsea.",
    "justification": "This collection of fabrics was created specifically for use on walls, designed to meet the specific needs of a wallcovering, such as ease of installation and a Class A fire rating. This collection contains a large swatch of each of 6 different designs, with smaller swatches showing additional colorways. The designs are a mix of subtle textures and solids, with the fabric content varying by sample but including silk, linen, flax, rayon, polyester and modacrylic. The use of modacrylic is significant as it is flame retardant and does not combust. It is also a highly durable fiber with a moderate resistance to abrasion. When modacrylics are mixed with natural fibers, they carry the look of the wool, linen or silk but meet the stringent safety requirements of contract installations.\n&amp;nbsp;\u201cKnoll Wall Collection,\u201d introduced in 1986, includes the original six designs from 1984 along with four new designs. Each of the designs is shown in multiple colorways for a total of 53 samples. ",
