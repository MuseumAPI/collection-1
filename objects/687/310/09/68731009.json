    "justification": "With its smoothly curved silhouette and minimal use of color, the Anywhere lamp is a landmark example of modernism applied to lighting design. It is also a product of Greta von Nessen\u2019s resilience as a designer and a businesswoman. After the death of her husband, designer Walter von Nessen, Greta reopened their design firm, Nessen Studios. While she resumed the production of Walter\u2019s most successful modern lighting designs, she began selling some of her own lighting innovations as well. Walter von Nessen\u2019s most iconic contribution to design is his series of angular swing arm lamps that allow the user to swivel the light source from one side of the lamp to the other. Greta\u2019s Anywhere Lamp is similarly functional. It can be placed on a table, mounted on a wall or suspended from the ceiling with a simple revolution of the enameled domed shade on its curved tubular framework. With the Anywhere lamp, Greta expanded upon her husband\u2019s design fundamentals, elevating lighting to a new level of streamlined form and utility. The strikingly modern lamp preserves the legacy of an exceptionally strong mid-twentieth century &amp;nbsp;designer. ",
