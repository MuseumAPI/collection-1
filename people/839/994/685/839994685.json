    "biography": "Kiff Slemmons is an American artist and metalsmith, most recognized for her work in jewelry, especially paper jewelry, done in collaboration with the Taller Arte Papel Oaxaca workshop in Mexico. Slemmons earned her B.A. in Art and French from the University of Iowa, which included a year of study at the Sorbonne in Paris. A self-taught metalsmith, she attended an eight week metalsmithing program in Japan through Parsons, The New School for Design in 1983. Creating conceptual and sculptural metal forms for thirty years, Slemmons also became known for her paper jewelry, which she started making in 2000 at the invitation of Mexican artist Francisco Toledo. Slemmons created paper jewelry for the artists at Taller Arte Papel Oaxaca, and her work in paper went on to gain an international following. By redefining the materials used to make jewelry, Slemmons subverts traditional views to create novel, invigorating pieces. Her jewelry is in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Arts and Design, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Slemmons currently lives in Chicago, and continues to produce jewelry and metalwork.",
