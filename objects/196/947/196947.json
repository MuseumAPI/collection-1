  "description": "The outer folder is constructed of glossy white cardboard. On the recto, both right and left flaps are folded toward the center, where they meet. An ideogram of a fleur de lis is depicted left of center on the left flap; a pair of horizontal-diagonal chopsticks occupies the comparable space on the right. Inside, a bottom flap with diagonally cut sides is folded about one third of the way up. The logo, placed close to the top edge of the flap, is comprised of a black-outlined shield with horizontal lines covering its left half; a miniature version of the fleur de lis in its right half; China Grill in sans serif capitals imprinted within a narrow band across the top; and a somewhat larger version of the chopsticks behind the shield.\r\n\r\nA lining of textured rice paper, inserted in the outer folder, is folded over to form narrow flaps on the folder recto. The pale green background is overlaid by a pattern of wavy lines in darker green, white and pink.",
