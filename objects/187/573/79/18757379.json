    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Apple's iPod and its variants, including the Nano and Shuffle, are among the most influential personal appliances of the twenty-first century. The iPod technology and distinctive, universally recognizable designs make these portable media players important in the continuum of industrial design, a major category for CHNDM's collection, a segment of which includes audio and image recording and playback devices. &amp;nbsp;The iPod has brought cultural shifts in our relationship to music and communications in the twenty-first century. Innovative technology makes it possible to store, carry, and share music, pictures, video, and movies with these increasingly diminutive, yet powerful, portable devices. &amp;nbsp;Current examples of the Nano and Shuffle are significant for their up to the minute technology, and for miniaturization. Multiple functions are embodied in models smaller than a pack of cigarettes or a tube of lipstick. Furthermore, they connect technology with fashion via color. Apple has created a color spectrum for the Nano and Shuffle that reflects contemporary taste.\n&amp;nbsp;\nApple Computer, Inc. founded in 1976, by Stephen Wozniak and Steve Jobs (now CEO of the firm), was well established as an innovator in the personal computer field by the time British designer Jonathan Ive joined the company in 1992. Ive rose to become the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design, and under his design direction in 1998-99, Apple introduced the iMac and iBook personal computer and laptop lines noted for their bulging, translucent, gumdrop-colored housings.&amp;nbsp; By 2001, the year the iPod was introduced as Apple's entry in the growing personal digital music player market, Ive's designs had shifted to a more minimalist aesthetic. The sleek, smooth forms in titanium or aluminum for their powerful computers were geared toward the business world, while glossy white casings were intended for the general consumer market. The original iPod with its iconic thin, rectangular shape and white face characterized this style. Building on the iPod's technology and success, in 2004 Apple introduced the first of its smaller iterations--the iPod Mini, a smaller, slimmer rectangular body that was enlivened by color (silver, pink, pale green, and blue) as part of the design brief. However, by 2005, Apple replaced the Mini with the Nano, available in only white or black, and launched the smallest iPod model, the Shuffle, about the size and shape of a pack of gum and offered only in white. The Shuffle was designed to be loaded with a selection of songs and play them only in random order\u2014\u201cshuffle\u201d\u2014hence no need for a display screen. Both music players clearly echoed the original iPod form and minimal color scheme. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe 2009 Nano reflects developments in technology and miniaturization, as well as changes in consumer expectations for personal electronic devices and their evolution as \u2018lifestyle tools.\u2019 The small, sleek anodized aluminum form is highly portable and comfortable to hold, and comes in nine deep jewel-like colors. The device is no longer just a music player; it has a microphone, FM radio tuner, and can also store and play visual media such as videos and movies on a 2.2\u201d color screen set above the now familiar clickwheel control. There is also a built in video camera, and for the fitness-minded, a pedometer. The Shuffle has evolved into a tiny, lozenge-shaped form of anodized aluminum, weighing less than half an ounce. It also comes in deep colors, and is almost as much a piece of jewelry as it is an entertainment device.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
