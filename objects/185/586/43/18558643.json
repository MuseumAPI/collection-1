    "description": "A dado is shown at the bottom, an entablature with a gilt ovolo at the bottom, on top. The lower part of the design suggests for the panel a division in vertical stripes. Broad blue stripes alternate with narrow white ones. Palmettes are suggested for the decoration of the latter ones. The broad stripes are subdivided in a broad central one of a lighter blue and two lateral narrow ones. These show outwardly directed plant palmettes. Vertical chains decorate the broad stripes, with plants in the painted ovoids. The upper part of the design suggests alternatively rows of circles, with plants in an inner disk. Disks with petals are in the wedges in the intervals of the circles. Two alternate designs are suggested for the plants, differing in the design and the coloring. The circles alternate as blue ones and blue and white ones. The background is formed by white lines upon blue and blue lines upon white. A colored garland crosses the design beneath the top.",
