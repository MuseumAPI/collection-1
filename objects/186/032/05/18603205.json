Two confronted horsemen flank a tree; they wear a green and blue tunic, respectively, and carry swords and shields rimmed with pearl bands and their cloaks stream out behind them. Above the horsemen, a pair of horizontal branches terminating in heart-shaped leaves support a pair of confronted animals, heads reversed. A human head in the field under each horseman. The inner border contains vegetal motifs, including heart-shaped flowers and trefoils. Inner and outer degraded \"pearl\" borders.",
