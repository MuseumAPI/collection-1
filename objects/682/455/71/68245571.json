    "justification": "Some of Horner's designs using interlaced scrolls, are extremely similar to ones Liberty made and this is an example that is especially close to a Liberty drawing (number 1114).&amp;nbsp;I is possible that some of Liberty\u2019s designs were executed by or for them by the Horner firm. Otherwise, it may be that Horner skillfully adapted a handmade style to one that could be more cost-effectively produced.\nHere the use of intelaced strips of silver shows an arrangement around the featured enamel, all of which would have been&amp;nbsp;produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most art nouveau style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. \nWhile most of the jewelry was mass-produced, using silver wire, ribbon or formed into swirls, circles and other shapes, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand and most was made in the basse-taille \u2013or shallow-cut- technique.&amp;nbsp; This technique involves cutting through engraving or chasing silver with bas-relief patterns and covering that in translucent enamel. Rich tonal qualities are achieved by varying the amounts of engraving and depth of enamel. \nThis brooch like most of the production&amp;nbsp;would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.",
