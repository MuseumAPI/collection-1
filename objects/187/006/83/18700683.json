    "description":"Panel of wool and silk felt in natural unbleached colors, made from the wool of sheep with various fleece characteristics \u2013 straight, curly, long, etc.",
    "justification":"This textile by Jongstra is a primary example of felting, which is a technique that uses the application of pressure, heat, and moisture to mat together fibers. Oftentimes the fibers are not spun or twisted, but are simply a mass of fibers lying indiscriminately in all directions.&amp;nbsp;Two fabrics in particular by Jongstra, Composition (DH\/WD\/SI 001), seen here, and Composition (SI 001) (2005-3-2), were commissioned specifically for the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt. They exemplify not only the general range of felting techniques, but also the variety of Jongstra\u2019s work.&amp;nbsp;This textile&amp;nbsp;is made of wool merino, Drenthe Heath, Wensley Dale, wild silk, and cotton gauze appears to come directly from the back of the sheep.
