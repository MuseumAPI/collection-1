  "description": "Recto of vertical sheet with sketches of two sailboats in shallows.  The boat in the upper half of the sheet has many of its components fully rendered: the masst, boom with wrapped sail, rigging, rudder, wooden hull and dinghy are all identifiable.  The boat's name is written across the side of the ship closest to the bow: IKWEI.  The boat in the lower half of the sheet is rendered in less detail and seems further from the viewer.  It is very similar to the boat above.  A figure stands in the water to the right of the boat.\r\n\r\nVerso of sheet has a single sketch of a small rod with holes for adjustment.  This is possibly part of a navigational instrument?",
