    "gallery_text": "Beginning in the late 17th century, Chinese carved ivory bris\u00e9 fans (Hu shan) were exported mainly from Canton to Europe, where they were extremely popular during the 18th century.  Hu shan can be translated as \u201crigid folding fan,\u201d and the term relates to Chinese ivory writing tablets (Hu) of earlier centuries. The European word bris\u00e9 refers to a fan that has no leaf and consists only of solid sticks held together with a narrow ribbon at the ends of the sticks.  The personal monogram on this fan indicates that it was made by special order for a European customer, probably for a wedding or as other significant gift. It was skillfully carved using specialized sharp tools and fresh ivory, and would have been a very expensive gift and prized possession.   A variety of textures are achieved through the carving of fine vertical lines combined with relief patterns of curving vines, flowers, birds, and pagodas.",
