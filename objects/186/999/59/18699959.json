    "justification":"Fiore, a dyed and printed cotton, was designed by Fortuny in the 1920s,and more than likely woven on a narrow loom in his home. The Fortuny Factory, on the Guidecca in Venice, opened in 1922, and half-width fabrics such as this were discontinued completely in the mid-1920s. This piece was probably made by Fortuny himself in the late teens or early twenties. The pattern itself is based on a Persian silk pattern and continues to be made today, but not in this color combination. The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of purple and pink, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, and is then overprinted with silver ink in a pattern of stylized flowers and vines.",
