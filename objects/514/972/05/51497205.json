    "justification": "Sheila Hicks describes what she does and how she thinks as &quot;channels of investigation.\u201d These explorations come in all media and sizes\u2014from pocket-size weavings or miniatures in silk and stainless steel to full-room installations of linen embroidery. This range reflects her experience at Yale\u2019s School of Art and Architecture, where she studied painting with Josef Albers and photography with Herbert Matter, as well as the years she lived and worked in South America studying Andean weavers and archaeological sites. \nAt the time of proposed acquisition, the museum is fortunate to have more than 20 examples of Hicks\u2019s &quot;channels of investigation&quot; in its collection. The works, which span most of her career as an artist and textile designer, include 20 miniatures made between 1957 and 2005 and two large panels representing embroidered works from 1967 and 1997, respectively. The museum has chosen to collect this artist in-depth because of her importance to the textile field during the 20th and 21st centuries. Hicks is one of the foremost American artists practicing today.\nPrayer Wall, created for her solo exhibition at Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Co. in 2012, would be the largest and most recent work by Hicks to enter the collection. The piece demonstrates a serendipitous sensibility\u2014its tussled texture invites touch and is a wonderful surface for the play of light and shadow. Prayer Wall relates directly to some of her large-scale commissioned work from the 1960s for the Ford Foundation, George Jensen\u2019s Center for Advanced Design, and Eero Saarinen\u2019s CBS Building. Hicks has collaborated with architects throughout her career, beginning in the late 1950s when she met the architects and engineers Luis Barrag\u00e1n, Ricardo Legoretta, and F\u00e9lix Candela. At that time, Hicks was moving away from presenting flat woven surfaces and, instead, inserting her work into space so that the surface, light, and color could interact.\nThe \u201ctassels\u201d that form Prayer Wall connect with the museum\u2019s own extraordinary collection of tassels from the 17th and 18th centuries. Braiding and knotting, key techniques in creating tassels, are very familiar to Hicks, who has used the techniques in her work over the years. In Prayer Wall, however, she wraps individual hanks of linen and then secures each one to the backing, thereby allowing the tassel to be more playful and unkempt rather than precisely controlled. Prayer Wall represents how an artist revisits a historic technique and\/or form and translates it into contemporary language.",
