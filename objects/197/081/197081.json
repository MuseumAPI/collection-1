  "description": "The photograph, situated in a fashion design office/ workroom, features a three-quarter length view of a model wearing a white, above-the-thigh, sleeveless bridal dress with a halter-style shirred neckline. The dress is overlaid by a white, transparent, hooded, tulle coat, apparently full-length, with long, full sleeves, gathered at the wrist. The model is turned slightly to her left and her arms are upraised in a V-shape. Isaac Mizrahi, the designer, wearing dark trousers and a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up, is leaning across the model, with his head bent and eyes focussed on the hem of the dress, which he is pinning. Light from the window on the right is centered on Mr. Mizrahi's shirt, while artificial light illuminates the rest of the scene. On the left, behind the model and designer, is a fashion assistant, seated at her desk, with a white telephone cradled in her right ear. There is a variety of papers and photographs on the worktable and wall behind the assistant. The photograph is set on a white page and the designer's logo is imprinted beneath.",
