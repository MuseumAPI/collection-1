  "description": "Vertical rectangle. Design for the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. Detail of a design for a ceiling divided into three compartments: a square and two half-oval sections. About one quarter of the design is shown, with the square containing the painted representation of a clouded sky, surmounted by a balustrade and a wide trellis-work border. The oval contains bamboo in striped pattern. Red Chinese fret. The shape tells us that it was intended for the conservatory. Roof is painted in imitation of the teakwood and rosewood.\r\n\r\nOriginal album associated with this collection still exists.  See 1948-40-1 accessory",
