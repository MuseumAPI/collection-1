    "description": "Small square sampler with bands of circles and squares filled with needle lace in a variety of patterns including hearts, crowns, flowers, and geometric motifs. One hollie point square has three crowns, WA, Mary Finkel 1730, and AC beneath the crowns. Border of acorns and plants.",

    "gallery_text": "Samplers originally served as sketchbooks where women could record stitches and design ideas for future use. With the advent of printed books of patterns for lace and embroidery in the 16th century, this practice became less common, and samplers evolved into exercises for girls learning the techniques of needlework. Several samplers of nearly identical format to this one, including those of Mary Tredwell (Victoria & Albert Museum), Sarah Leesley (Museum of Fine Art, Boston) and Mary Brown in this collection, mark these samplers definitively as school exercises. \nBeginning with a plain piece of fine linen, fourteen squares and fourteen circles were cut out. Some were filled with needle lace, most likely adapted from pattern books. Others are filled with hollie-point embroidery, in which tiny holes are left in densely worked buttonhole stitch, giving the appearance of patterned knitting. Hollie point was very much in fashion for ornamenting baby clothes and christening sets in the 1720s and 30s.",
    "label_text": "This sampler combines hollie point and needle-lace filling stitches, both worked in openings cut in the fine linen foundation. Hollie point leaves spaces in otherwise densely worked buttonhole stitches, while the needle lace is built up from the barest scaffold of threads.",
