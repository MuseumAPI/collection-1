    "description": "Vertical rectangle. Form of a horseshoe, similar to 1940-21-22. The central panel has the same shape. In the center is a circular medallion with a standing lyre with two hanging laurel wreaths in front of two crossed trumpets and rays. It is surrounded by a circle formed by a Greek motive and farther away by another, for which two alternative suggestions are made: a cresting border with alternating blossoms and palmettes, and lyres connected by scrolls; two dancers, slightly skteched with pencil, are seemingly remnants of an earlier idea. Below are two triangles. This panel is framed by a band in the shape of a horseshoe; octagons alternate in it with lozenges. In the latter are dnacing girls. A moulding frames the central panel with the band. Outside is a corresponding frieze with, alternating: a swan supporting a garland or, at the base, two wreaths, and a standing trophy consisting of a candelabrum, two harps, branches, two wreaths. The part near the stage is divided into many oblongs and triangles. The details at the right side are not entirely executed.",
