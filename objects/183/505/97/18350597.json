    "description":"A room interior with two brown-draped, white-curtained windows at left and an open door at right. A dog sits at the foot of a central table, where an array of objects is displayed. Behind and partly obscured by the table, a woman wearing a black bonnet sits just to the left of a dark gray fireplace. A mirror hangs above the mantelpiece, which is decorated with a clock flanked by two vases, all in bell jars. In the front of the room on the left, another woman, dressed in a white gown, sits at a dressing table, her image reflected in the mirror.  Additional furnishings include a chest placed between the windows; a sofa, ottoman and chair on the right; and framed drawings hung on the walls.",
