  "description": "Dress-weight plain weave cotton, printed in four colors: brown, dark purple, light green, and dark yellow. The dark purple is used as the background of the pattern, while the white or unprinted areas are part of the image. The pattern depicts fashionable ladies of the 1950s visiting an art museum, possibly the Museum of Modern Art in New York. One cluster of ladies is being lectured by a male professor with a pointer. Another is seated on a round banquette. There is also a male museum guard in uniform, and some potted plants. One painting, \"The Sleeping Gypsy\" by Henri Rousseau, is specific and recognizable, others are less specific: a vase with sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh, a harlequin by Pablo Picasso, a portrait by Henri Matisse, a sculpture by Alexander Calder, a small canvas by Piet Mondrian. \r\n",
