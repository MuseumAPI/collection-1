    "description": "Cream-colored ground with a decorative pattern of a dark blue circle on the edge from which are suspended four designs connected by fine blue lines to a fine blue inner circle, alternating with three brown brown squares, with the Roycroft logo in one panel.",
    "justification": "Roycroft began in 1897&amp;nbsp; with Elbert Hubbard, in East Aurora NY . From the beginning it was more than a manufactory; it came to signify a&amp;nbsp;way of life&amp;nbsp;as part of a commitment to the&amp;nbsp;arts and crafts movement philosophy.&amp;nbsp; For more than 20 years, the Roycroft Campus was a hub of activity with over five hundred working artisans and craftsmen and drew visitors from long distances. In 1905 the Roycroft Inn was opened to accommodate visitors and artisans looking to experience this emerging community and style. &amp;nbsp;Made as part of the complete look for Roycroft, these plates, with their influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, were designed for the Roycroft Inn and display the logo with the orb and lines as part of the decoration on the rim. While The Buffalo Pottery Company produced a large line of wares in increasing numbers from about 1905, it developed a separate line of vitreous china for restaurants and hotels in 1914, and it is likely that this plate was an early commission at this time.",
