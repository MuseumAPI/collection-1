    "biography": "Understated and ethereal, glamorous and erotic, radical and mutant\u2014makeup in the hands of Pat McGrath is utterly transformative. It not only complements the runway fashion, editorials, and ads it graces, but also elevates them. McGrath\u2019s makeup is definitive, setting a mood, illuminating a character, or driving a narrative. And in a career that has spanned over twenty years, her range and indefatigable innovation are astounding. She has created some of the catwalk\u2019s most iconic visages, using bold and neon colors, crystal embellishments, gold foil, exaggerated faux brows, ridiculously long lashes, and so much more. Since 2004, McGrath has also been global creative design director for Procter & Gamble, where she distills runway looks into some of makeup\u2019s biggest trends, including a selfie-proof matte liquid foundation. McGrath\u2019s encyclopedic range of aesthetic innovation leads her to constantly redefine notions of beauty as a visionary in her field.",
