    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The Philco electronics firm was founded in the late 1890's in Philadelphia and became a leading manufacturer of audio products, particularly low-priced radios. Philco television sets of the late 1950's and early 60's have now become some of the most iconic American television designs, made with a 'swivel' screen so that viewers could adjust the monitor to face them at various angles in a room. The Predicta model television set was first introduced by Philco in 1958 as the first of several transportable television models produced in the late 1950's. This first design, made in both pedestal and wood-case models were floor-standing units. The Predicta's trademark 'low neck' screen was a departure from the classic home television and was first produced for the Holiday Inn hotel chain before it became popular with the 1960's consumer market. \nThe 17&quot; Philco 'Princess' is a tabletop television; the screen sits atop a case of perforated metal making it particularly compact and light-weight. As the name suggests, these models were marketed for women, particularly for the home-maker who could adjust the position of her TV while doing housework. The Predicta Princess is one example in a tred of product designs specifically targeting the female consumer in the late 1950's and 60's. \nThe Predicta's modern casign was an intentional departure from traditional, more bulky television designs, partially as a result of dwindling TV sales in the late 1950's. The futuristic aesthetic was influenced by an interest in 'space age' technology, prompted by Russia's Sputnik lauch in 1957. Advertisements touted, 'TV today from the world of tomorrow.' Additionally, the transportable, table-top model was a break from stationary television cases that mimicked furniture-like radio receivers of the early 20th century. The move towards portability marked a change in American living-room culture from the television as a familiy's central gathering point, towards a more individual interaction with TV.&quot;",
