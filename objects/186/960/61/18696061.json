    "justification": "One of Nuno\u2019s best examples of integrating \u201chard-core\u201d industry into their textile making process is with Stainless Steel Gloss, which was designed in 1990 by Sudo. After the polyester filament has been woven and then calendar pressed, it is spatter plated with stainless steel. This is a process used primarily in the automobile industry for plating car parts. The result is a semi-transparent fabric that appears to have a fluidity akin to liquid mercury. It is an important example of an existing manufacturing process that is used in a totally different way, as well as in an unexpected medium. Sudo goes beyond the conventional boundaries of textile design and relies on other areas of industry for creative inspiration. ",
