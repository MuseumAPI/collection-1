    "justification": "\nFelix Pf\u00e4ffli designed this poster to promote the music house Salzhaus in Winterthur, Switzerland. Salzhaus invites a different designer each month to design their program. They give no design brief, and the posters that they produce are remarkably varied. Pf\u00e4ffli decided to focus on a typographic design using the venue\u2019s name. He used a font that he had initially designed to be used for single-day workshops that he runs for his students. The fonts simplicity belies its more complex potential, for it is intended to &quot;distort, warp and disassemble&quot;. Layered over each other, the letterforms read as a vibrant abstract composition as much as a linear rendering of a name.",
