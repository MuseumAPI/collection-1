    "biography": "In 1980, Elizabeth Garouste joined Mattia Bonetti and established a design force in Paris. Their focus encompasses nature, history and technology.  Garouste started her career designing shoes and handbags. In 1987, the design team was invited to collaborate with fashion designer Christian Lacroix to design his salon. Garouste-Bonetti looks to wrought-iron furniture, baroque grandeur, and primitive fantasy to create their style which was dubbed \u201cneo-primitivist\u201d.",
