    "biography": "Neil Bottle is textile designer who specializes in limited edition hand-printed, painted, and stenciled textiles for fashion and interiors. After graduating from Middlesex University in 1989 Bottle won the Painters-Stainers Prize for printed textiles and used his grant to set up his own design studio in Kent. Since establishing his studio Bottle has been designing and manufacturing fashion and interior accessories under his own label for over twenty years. Bottle also studied at The University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates allowing him to research textiles on an international level. Bottle has been commissioned by private clients and large companies. He has worked as a consultant for projects with The British Museum, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre London, The Royal Academy of Art, and the Guggenheim in New York. In the fashion world, Bottle has designed for several important department stores including Harrods, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nBottle\u2019s silk designs create an illusion of depth and a richness of pattern, texture, and color. He layers the decorative elements to convey a three-dimensional quality.  Each fabric is individually dyed, stenciled, and painted. Over the years his influences have developed from botanical and architectural to abstract. Bottle has recently experimented with digital design and printing options, pushing the boundaries of technology in his artistic practice. He is intrigued by the relationship between digital textile print technologies and craft techniques.",
