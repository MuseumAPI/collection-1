    "justification": "The Wiggle stool is from architect Frank Gehry\u2019s Easy Edges furniture series. In creating his laminated cardboard furniture, Gehry said his intent was to make \u201cthe Volkswagen of furniture\u201d by utilizing a material that was inexpensive and easy to work with.[1] Rather than folding cardboard into boxy forms, however, Gehry was inspired by the layered construction of architectural models and worked with the material in laminated layers as if it were a solid. He used the exposed edges as his surface, achieving a highly textural effect. Gehry devised a construction method and an efficient die-cutting manufacturing system that allowed him to create a wide range of shapes, including the ribbon-like forms seen in the compressed curves of the Wiggle stool. Gehry\u2019s cardboard furniture could be produced quickly and sold at low prices.\nThis stool relates to two examples of Gehry\u2019s laminated cardboard seating held by the museum at the time of proposed acquisition: a side chair (1988-79-1) and a lounge chair (1988-79-2). The Wiggle stool\u2019s form is far less conventional in comparison, with its whiplash curves. The three pieces together would provide a good range of seating forms that could be achieved through Gehry\u2019s cardboard construction and manufacturing methods.\n[1]\u201cGiants of American Design,\u201d House Beautiful, June 2006.",
