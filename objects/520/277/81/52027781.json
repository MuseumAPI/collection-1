    "justification": "\nThis ca. 1928 compact fitted tea service, comprising a teapot, creamer, sugar bowl and tray, was part of the Dinette line of tea sets geared for the modern-minded woman. Considered revolutionary, these sets were created by the International Silver Company\u2019s Wilcox Silver Plate division as a modern line, space savers for the smaller rooms common in most city apartments. While the design was first developed by the International Silver Company staff designer Jean George Theobald, whose background was in jewelry design, the company engaged self-described \u201cdecorative arts consultant,\u201d Virginia Hamill to refine the forms. Hamill was one of the few women practicing product design in the 1920s and 30s, a time when the profession of industrial design was coming into being. This Dinette set, the most capacious of three models, shows an emphasis on function and process by utilizing clean, simple cylindrical forms with flat, circular, tightly fitted lids and trapezoidal ebonized wood handles, easy to grasp and hold. The teapot, sugar bowl and creamer nestle closely together in the shaped carrying tray. The set could be easily carried as a unit and required less storage space in the apartments of design-savvy urbanites. The level of sophistication demonstrated by this Dinette set is not surprising given Hamill\u2019s extensive exposure to European modernist works by designers such as French silversmith Jean Puiforcat and Marianne Brandt of the Bauhaus in Germany. \nHamill played an active role in developing design exhibitions, particularly in American department stores and retail showrooms where the widest range of domestic consumers could see displays of the latest furnishings and wares for the home. While the Wilcox Silver Plate Company produced Dinette sets in silver-plated metal, this example by the Old Colony Pewter firm is made of polished pewter, a less costly alternative to silver or silver-plate during the Depression years. Durable and easier to clean than silver, a convenience that modern homemakers appreciated, polished pewter also exhibits a softer luster than chrome-plated metals, another popular material of the time. Dinette sets could also be customized with the addition of a monogram: here the block letter G is prominently engraved on each piece in the group. This innovative modernist set presents an interesting departure from the historical and colonial revival forms more often associated with American pewter of the early twentieth century.",
