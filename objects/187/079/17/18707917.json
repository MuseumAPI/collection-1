    "description": "Supplementary warps very loosely bound leave long floats meandering over the surface, in deep shades of blue and green.",
    "justification": "SALT is a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, and specializes in custom window treatments for commercial and residential interiors. Swindell holds a BA in Textile Design from Liverpool University and an MA in Woven Textiles from Trent University. Thomas studied Textile Design at Leeds University and completed a Masters in Knitted Textiles at the Royal College of Art. Both teach and lecture throughout the UK. Swindell is herself a weaver, and the company also employs five additional hand-weavers in a cottage-industry model to make samples and weave their products. \nFor ten years, the pair has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because they have focused on window treatments, they are concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and nighttime lighting. Many of their textiles play with sheerness and opacity-- with areas to look at and areas to look through, surfaces which attract the eye and others which allow light, and vision, to pass through. These pieces will update a collection of casement and architectural textiles with similar concerns, from such important designers as Anni Albers, Marianne Strengell, and Jack Lenor Larsen. \nKingfisher Floats uses a supplementary warp infrequently bound in to create a loose, rippled surface. This combines with the subtly shifting colors of the blue\/green palate to create a sense of movement. ",
