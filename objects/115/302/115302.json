  "description": "The profile, in dark outline, depicts a high forehead; long nose turned upward at the tip; full, closed lips; and rounded chin. The eyelid and empty eye socket are also depicted in outline. A curved line framing the face on the left serves as one edge of a headdress, limited here to a border, in a scrolling pattern. Long, dangling, three-tiered earrings in a geometric pattern extend to the lower edge of the neck, where they stop short of the curved, patterned necklace (or neckline).",
