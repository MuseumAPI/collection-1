    "justification": "\nThe Paper Porcelain series was originally conceived as a project to translate paper models \u2013 an integral part of Scholten &amp; Baijings\u2019s process \u2013 into porcelain. Stefan Scholten and Carole Baijings started the process with their drawing, in which Scholten sketched the saucers and Baijings the cups, working out form, color, and geometry for the series. The designers then created the cut, folded, scored, and taped cardboard models, which were made into unglazed porcelain prototypes during a three-month residency at the European Ceramic Work Center in \u2018s-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch), The Netherlands. The cardboard models were first cast into polyurethane rubber molds in order to capture the surface texture of the cardboard. Plaster models were cast from these polyurethane rubber molds, followed by plaster production molds produced for the porcelain slip casting. \n\nColor is an important element in Scholten &amp; Baijings\u2019s work. To recreate the light grey, spotted color of the original cardboard, the designers developed a specific mix of glaze and porcelain to which they added metal drill dust to achieve the unique spots found in the cardboard. The paper tape used to bind the incised lines in the cardboard saucer models was recreated on the prototypes using glazes, which were color-tested to ensure they matched the original tape color. Pencil lines applied by hand to the porcelain prototypes emphasized the scored lines found on the cardboard models. The faceting and grid-like surface pattern of the Paper Porcelain series are elements seen across the designers\u2019 work.\n\nThe Paper Table series, of which Paper Porcelain is a part, was awarded a Dutch Design Award in 2010 and a Wallpaper* Design Award in 2011.",
