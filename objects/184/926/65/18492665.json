    "description":"The piece was designed and executed to celebrate the American Bicentennial. In the center is one of founding fathers preparing to sign the Declaration of Independence while to his left and right are two patriots assisting him. To the left are seated eight additional signers. The scene is framed by a leaf-like scroll with the Liberty Bell at the top. On either side of the Bell is a symmetrical arrangement of mountain peaks and American bald eagles. On the sides are American Indians with tomahawks and teepees. On the bottom left and right are Independence Hall and Capitol Building. A plaque at the bottom reads: \"1776 Declaration of Independence.\"",
