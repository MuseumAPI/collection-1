The whole is encased in the four-sided matte black cardboard wrapper (1993-151-430 - 1), which when closed forms a triangular shape, of which two sides are fastened in the center by a thin red string attached to metal grommets surrounded by black reinforcements. The wrapper's principal face is adorned in the center by a pale silver-colored label, outlined in black and imprinted M&Co (lower case italics)/ Labs (small sans serif capitals). \r\n\r\n1993-151-430 - 4 - The cardboard insert folds lengthwise in the center. On the recto, a photographic view in tones of gray shows a gondola car, passengers within, suspended on cables within a mountainous landscape.

On the verso, except for a strip of the recto landscape located on the right edge, product information covers the surface.\r\n\r\n1993-151-430 - 5 - The design on the white paper tab consists of an imprint, in miniature, of the face of the Askew wristwatch, reproduced in black at the lower end.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
