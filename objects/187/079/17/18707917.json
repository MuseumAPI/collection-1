    "description": "Supplementary warps very loosely bound leave long floats meandering over the surface, in deep shades of blue and green.",
    "justification": "Kingfisher Floats uses a supplementary warp infrequently bound in to create a loose, rippled surface. This combines with the subtly shifting colors of the blue-green palette to create a sense of movement. Kingfisher Floats was designed by Salt, a textile design firm that specializes in custom window treatments for commercial and residential interiors. \nSince 1997, the Salt has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because the firm has focused on window treatments, it is concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and evening lighting. Many of Salt\u2019s textiles play with sheerness and opacity\u2014areas to look at and to look through, surfaces that attract the eye, and others that allow light and vision to pass through. Kingfisher Floats, together with Horsehair and Longitude, will update a collection of casement and architectural textiles with similar concerns from such important designers as Anni Albers, Marianne Strengell, and Jack Lenor Larsen.",
    "gallery_text": "Salt., a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, specializes in custom window treatments. Many of the pair\u2019s textiles play with sheerness and opacity, exemplified in \u201cKingfisher Floats,\u201d whose particular weave filters light and vision, simultaneously allowing through and blocking both. This textile was made using an infrequently bound in supplementary warp to create a loose, textured surface. Combined with the subtle blue-green palette, this texture creates a sense of movement.",
