  "description": "The package components are assembled as follows: the pocket watch [not present] is inserted in the incised area of the wooden wedge-shaped stand (1993-151-431a), which is overlaid by the wedge cover (1993-151-431b); that ensemble is inserted in the bottom of the box (1993-151-431d), with the insert (1993-151-431c) underneath, and covered by the box lid.\r\n\r\n1993-151-431-1 - An incision replicating the shape of the watch and its winder is carved in the top of the stand.\r\n\r\n1993-151-431-2 - A round shape replicating the watch is incised in the upper side of the navy blue cardboard stand cover. Cheers from M&Co is imprinted in white sans serif type above the incision. When the components are assembled (see above), the M&Co phrase is visible through the round incision of the box lid.\r\n\r\n1993-151-431-3 - This six-panel insert in a black and ivory color scheme is placed in the box bottom and is arranged so that Waste/ Not/ A/ Moment, imprinted in capitals and centered between two stylized curved branches with leaves, is visible to the viewer. Two other consecutive panels feature the M&Co logo, along with illustrations of the watch and stand and explanatory type. A warranty registration form and related printed matter comprise the remaining three panels.\r\n\r\n1993-151-431d - A small circle is incised in the upper right hand corner of the box lid (see above 1993-151-431b).",
