  "description": "Design is a reproduction of a late 18th century French commemorative paper, evidently in honor of a composer because of the musical instruments displayed. Diamond-shaped vignettes with sides outlined with laurel leaves and evergreens contain alternating scenes. One shows an open circular colonnade with a male bust on a pedestal within and two putti are flying about. Alternating scene depicts tombstone with classic urn on top and surrounded by trees. The designs on either side are composed of lyres and tambourines. Found in Joseph Hebbes' house in Edenton, NC. Built in 1757-65.",
