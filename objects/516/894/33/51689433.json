    "justification":"\nIn tandem with her artistic practice, Sheila Hicks has been engaged with the fields of architecture, design, and textile industry for over fifty years. Early in her career she created commercial designs for Knoll Textiles and Commonwealth Trust of Calicut, India. Inca, a design based on her Yale Master\u2019s thesis and study of pre-Incaic textiles, remained in the Knoll catalogue for 24 years, and Badagara has been in continuous production at CommTrust for over 45 years. Crossing Colors is Hick\u2019s latest commercial collaboration. Working with Momentum Textiles, she has created a collection of three patterned weaves: Painting Strokes, Drawing Lines, and Crossing Colors, plus coordinating solids, Weaving Palettes. \nUnlike the works from the 1960s, which were both hand-woven and designed at the loom, Crossing Colors faithfully interprets drawings from Hicks\u2019s Couleurs Crois\u00e9es series. Working from the original drawings in graphite and felt tip pen on paper or canvas, Momentum took great care to preserve the evidence of the hand. Two of the designs have full-width horizontal repeats, an unusual feature that preserves the continuity of the line and the illusion of filling a sheet of paper. In Painting Strokes, the weaving structure chances to replicate the deepening of color where two translucent layers overlap, and records the end of the stroke just before the selvedge edge. For Drawing Lines, a basket weave ground was used to mimic the texture of the cotton canvas on which the original artwork was drawn, irregular insertion of the pattern wefts suggests the gritty texture of the graphite line work. In her artwork, Hicks often builds spaces with color and line; Crossing Colors perhaps most directly draws on that long-standing practice. \n",
