  "description": "The lower edges of three Formica (tm) rectangles are inserted in clear plastic jackets, covering about one-third of the rectangles and mounted in a row on white cardboard. Each rectangle has a hole punched near the top; two of three possible ideographic designs, one imprinted directly beneath the hole and the second just above the lower edge; and multiple lines of type in upper and lower case, with highlighted content capitalized. The three rectangles comprise an invitation to a Formica Corporation event: the leftmost, in a gold-mustard color, extends the invitation; the central, in dusty pink, specifies the venue; and the rightmost, in  silver-green, describes the program, featuring Tibor Kalman, and calls for invitees to respond. The whole is enclosed in a white envelope.",
