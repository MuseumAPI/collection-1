    "description": "Black and white photo from the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York shows a hockey player in a USA jersey kneeling on the ice and raising his arms in a gesture of triumph. A teammate lies sprawled beneath him on the ground and a huddled group of players is visible in the back right. Beneath the photo, bold, black text on taupe ground reads \"THE BOY NEXT DOOR \/ JUST DISCOVERED \/ AMERICA.\" Smaller black type to the left of this reads \"Somewhere along the line we lost it. \/ We stopped believing. Then the kid \/ next door won a gold medal. A kid with \/ a runny nose and milk money danced up \/ to the tiger and spit in his eye. \/ It's not a fluke. Not an upset. Not a \/ longshot, dark horse or a David and \/ Goliath. \/ It's a miracle. \/ It's America. \/ Welcome back. \/ Congratulations to the United States \/ of America from Wonderland Park.\"",
