It is \/ an early idea for a house he later built \/ for one of the Blairs Wm. [?] near Lake \/  Forest, Ill. \/ I personally think Adler the best residential \/ architect in the middle west and one of the best \/ in the whole country. He has done some of the largest \/ residences in the country.  Aside from Chicago such \/ things as the R.T.Crane house, Ipswich, Mass. Newhall \/ Field's residence on 70th St. and lately Wm [?] E.M. Fields \/ house on Long Island. \/ Sketches of his are rare.  If you wrangle out of him \/ the rendering he did for the N.Y. house of the Fields you \/ would be lucky but do not mention this sketch as he \/ no longer speaks to me and might resent it.",
