    "description":"Scene depicted is \"Adoration of the Magi.\" In foreground is seated the Virgin, dressed in sixteenth-century-style costume (dark blue, light blue, red, with gold decoration), holding nude child on lap. Child blesses bearded man kneeling, presenting box. Behind in center is Joseph(?)--at least someone worthy of a crown and fine areignment--holding a covered goblet in one hand, other hand upraised. Servant-like figure on left on left in white with gold-trim costume, also holding covered object. On right is a bearded man in blue tunic standing in archway. Much use of translucent enamels and gold detailing. Colorful marble-like wall behind scene. No indication of a signature.",
