A panel recedes at left. A lion crouches on top. The top of the rear is to show fasces btween two seated figures. At right: an elevation of the back. Women with cornucopias, seated upon crouching lions, are suggested on top of the curved back; they flank a medallion with a figure symbolizing the Republic. Broad dark brown stripes along the edges.",
