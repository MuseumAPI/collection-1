  "description": "Two rinceaux are connected by two snakes and a leaf.  The latter forms, together with a calix, the support of a round table top, upon which a bowl stands on three tall legs.  Smoke emerges from the bowl. Two cornucopias are placed in the ring connecting the legs. Stems in heart form spring from them. Above, two birds sit upon festoons.",
