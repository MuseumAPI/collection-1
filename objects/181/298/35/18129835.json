    "description": "A design for a single candelabrum.  At the bottom, lions, crouching on a base, support a pavilion, on the volutes of which are seated two female figures: \"Strength,\" at left and \"Faith,\" at right.  At the center stands a Papal escutcheon.  On top of the dome stands a capital, supporting a sphere.  The sphere is surrounded  by a band with St. John the Evangelist, St. Paul, St. Peter, another saint with a book, and St. Mark, and is topped by clouds with the Dove and cherubim.  From the clouds rises a balustrade, in a circle of winged female figures.  The balustrade supports the bowl, form which festoons are suspended, and the socket.  \nUnder the base line is an inscription and scale.",
