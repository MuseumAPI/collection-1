    "biography": "Coray was born in Wald, Switzerland on June 9, 1906, and died in Zurich on November 22, 1991. A pioneer of industrial design, his work is admired for its simplicity and functionality. He was a sculptor, primarily in metal, as well as a painter, and held a doctorate in Romance language and literature. He was part of a creative circle that included Max Bill and Anton Stankowski. His other designs include upholstered and wire seating and, in the 1950s, aluminum chairs and tables for Wohnbedarf (a progressive high-design shop founded in 1931). In connection with the 1939 Swiss National Exhibition, he also worked on the interiors of several pavilions (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",
