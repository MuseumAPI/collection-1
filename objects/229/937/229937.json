  "description": "This view of Prince Karl of Prussia's study in the Ordnugs-Palais reflects the Mooresque style in the patterned carpet, drapery and cushioned banquettes reflected in the large mirror at the right. The walls are lined in a textile patterned on a Gothic Revival motif. The focal point of the room is a large Schinkel-designed galleried desk inset with panels of amber-colored molded glass; a top shelf displays a collection of vases, bottles and other treasures. On the left, two marble plinths holding potted plants possibly serve as a room divider. A copy or version of Cristofano Allori's Judith with the Head of Holofernes, in a frame designed by Schinkel, hangs on the wall at the left rear.",
