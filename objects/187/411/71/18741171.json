    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;With its flowing organic forms, American industrial designer Russel Wright's American Modern dinnerware was unlike anything designed for the American market in 1937. It took Wright two years to find a manufacturer willing to produce it. The design of the service, which included idiosyncratic serving pieces such as this celery dish with folded rim, expressed Wright's philosophy of informal entertaining. The pieces were to be used in interchangeable combinations of six earthy, low-key colors, Seafoam Blue, Granite gray, Chartreuse, Curry, Coral, Bean Brown, and a warm white. Consumers were encouraged to buy place settings at a low price in the hope that they would complete their sets from open stock. The pattern proved very popular, selling over eighty million pieces between 1939 and 1959.&quot;",
