    "description":"White form of moveable folding elements. Closed position: tight cylinder of 12 legs each hinged at joint with seat element, in turn hinged at top to small circle with inset handle. Form furls out into circular seat composed of 12 wedges spiraling out from central circle with handle; each wedge with hinged leg twisting down into a central shaft, then flaring out to form stable, 12-footed base. Nylon surfaces shows lines and marks of layering from laser syntering process.",
    "justification":"The One__Shot.MGX folding stool is a highly functional form, designed to be manufactured by rapid prototyping technology, a revolutionary process that is essentially digital three-dimensional printing.&amp;nbsp; A relatively new development, rapid prototyping has most often been employed to produce medical devices or industrial items such as car parts. Patrick Jouin and the manufacturer Materialise NV are among the first designers and fabricators to explore this nascent technology for production of furniture, lighting, and products for the domestic landscape. The all-digital technology allows designers (and eventually consumers) freedom to create a variety of forms that can be customized and produced as limited editions or unique works, and presents an alternative to earlier mass production methods that relied on standardization to achieve ease of manufacture and low cost to the consumer. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThis stool is a single unit of hinged or twisting parts, but it is not made by conventional manufacture and assembly (the name is derived from the fact that it is made all at once--in one shot). Jouin's design is rendered into a three-dimensional computer image that is sliced horizontally, then 'printed,' layer-by-layer, hinges and all, via laser sintering, an additive manufacturing method that uses a powerful laser to fuse powdered material, here Polyamide (nylon), into a three-dimensional object. Contact between the laser beam and the nylon hardens the material to produce the three-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses the nylon by scanning cross-sections generated from the 3-D digital description (e.g. CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed.&amp;nbsp; After each cross-section is scanned by the laser, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the stool is complete.\n&amp;nbsp;",
