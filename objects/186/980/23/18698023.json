    "justification":"\nThis collection of ribbons is the most recent examples by the textile artist, Laura Forest Nicholson, also known for her handwoven brocaded tapestries.&amp;nbsp; In these vibrant, humorous and graphically appealing ribbons, she creates movement and exuberance using units of repetition.&amp;nbsp; She interprets the ribbon as &quot;the industrial equivalent of the tapestry: an ornate and often elaborate woven textile with its only function being to provide decoration, richness, and a sense of delight.&quot;\nNicholson received her MFA at Cranbrook Academy of Art and has lectured, taught classes and workshops, and exhibited extensively in the United States.&amp;nbsp; Her tapestries are in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Denver Art Museum, The Archives of the Venice Biennale, and Cranbrook Academy of Art Museum. In addition, the Cooper-Hewitt acquired a tapestry in 1996, &quot;Everything for the Garden&quot;, which is a large and playfully composed tapestry depicting garden tools, vegetables, and flowers.&amp;nbsp; Her ribbons are designed in the same spirit.\nThe textile department has a wonderful collection of ribbons and ribbon sample books, which are dated much earlier than this proposed gift.&amp;nbsp; Nicholson's ribbons are unique in the contemporary world of ribbons in their sophisticated playfulness and offer a light-hearted and visually appealing counterpart to the often seriously elegant designs of most ribbons today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ",
