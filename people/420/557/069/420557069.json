    "biography": "Little Sun is a socially-conscious business based in Germany but whose global mission is to address the need for light in underdeveloped regions. It seeks to bring light to these communities in a sustainable way that creates jobs, stimulates local industry, and brings good design and engineering to the off-grid communities that need light the most. Little Sun launched in July, 2012 at the Tate Modern in London and has distributed over 200,000 Little Sun lamps across the world; the objects are currently distributed in over ten African countries as well as communities in Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, and the United States. For every Little Sun lamp sold to customers in regions with widespread electricity, the company delivers a Little Lamp to an African community at a price scaled to that community\u2019s economy. In this way, Little Sun is not a charity but instead an inclusive business that works with local populations to foster entrepreneurship and build infrastructure for the distribution of lamps. This business model does more than bring light to regions that need it most, it brings training and education that allow these communities to flourish and grow.",
