    "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating a design for knotted berlin work that depicts a repeated oval of mauve roses on a teal blue ground.  Between the ovals are sprays of white flowers with yellow centers flanked by russet flowers and greenery.  Framing the ovals are additional white and blue flowers with small golden plants that are possibly sheaves of wheat.  The entire composition is on a white ground with two parallel borders of altnerating golden and brown stripes. A publication title is at the top, and details about the design and where to obtain materials for it are located in the bottom margin. The paper also had a grid-like impression that gives it the texture of canvas.",
