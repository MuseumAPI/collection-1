    "justification": "\nHideko Takahashi (b.1950) is part of a younger generation of Japanese designers working within what now could be considered a tradition of Japanese experimentation with textile forms and surfaces. Educated at the Otsuka Textile Design Institute, Takahashi has also studied and apprenticed with Junichi Arai, one of the pre-eminent textile designers of the last twenty years.&amp;nbsp; She learned from Arai the importance of combining both the hand and advanced technology in textile design and production. Takahashi has focused her investigations and experimentations primarily in the medium of wool fiber and has transformed two-dimensional planes of wool into three-dimensional sculptural surfaces.&amp;nbsp; \nCircle Square II, designed by Takahashi in 1995, exemplifies varied experiments with the shrinking and cutting of a triple layered cloth resulting in what seems to be a single layer with appliqu\u00e9d pockets. Takahashi describes her three-layer textiles as a \u201ctwo-layer cake\u201d.&amp;nbsp; She distinguishes the alternating blue-and-white colored layers that comprise the \u201ccake\u201d by cutting weft threads that float above the base cloth. A felting process shrinks the cloth and diminishes its size by twenty percent. The textile is then acid dyed, causing further shrinkage so that when finished the length is fifty-three percent and the width thirty-eight percent of the original size. \n&amp;nbsp;\n",
