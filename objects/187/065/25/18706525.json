    "justification":"The selected papers are all boldly designed and brightly colored and representative of the period.&amp;nbsp; The papers can be roughly divided into two groups:&amp;nbsp; those with a printed ground color and those without.\nThe papers with the ground color are printed on a slightly heavier paper stock and would have been more expensive to produce.&amp;nbsp; The ground color is a very dense opaque pigment and is the first color applied covering the paper from selvedge to selvedge.&amp;nbsp; Applying the ground color is a separate process from printing the design colors and requires a separate printing machine.&amp;nbsp; When the design is printed all of the colors are printed in one pass through the printing press.&amp;nbsp; The ground color serves the important function of giving the paper a uniform color.&amp;nbsp; As the paper ages and oxidizes the ground hides the fact that the once white paper is now turning brown.&amp;nbsp; It can greatly extend the life of the wallpaper.&amp;nbsp; This became especially important after the introduction of wood pulp papers in the 1850s.&amp;nbsp; Some of the papers in this group are printed to hide the fact there is no ground but on others the visible paper support has been worked into the overall pattern.\nWhile this second group of papers was less costly they are still beautifully styled.&amp;nbsp; They are printed on a paper stock that is lighter in weight than their grounded peers but is still of a decent quality.&amp;nbsp; \nFrom the group with the printed ground comes the one identifiable paper.&amp;nbsp; This was designed by Robert Duflos, an artist of French origin known for his figural and still life paintings.&amp;nbsp; This design was produced in two runs, in 1926-27 and again in 1930-31.&amp;nbsp; The original drawing for this design is in the Bibliotheque Forney in Paris.
