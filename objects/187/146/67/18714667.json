    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Jorie Johnson trained at the Rhode Island School of Design and has been working in Japan for nearly twenty years, focusing on innovative ways to use felt in design objects. Clifton Monteith, a furniture maker, travelled to Japan to study traditional urushi lacquer technique.&amp;nbsp; After years of experimentation they have been able to develop a technique for the creation of small vessels incorporating both felt and lacquer.\nLacquer is based on sap, and therefore needs to cure, rather than dry like paint.&amp;nbsp; Normally the curing is effected with heat and moisture; alternatively it occurs with protein such as egg whites, tofu or rice paste blended with urushiol sap, creating a very different effect.&amp;nbsp; Johnson wondered whether the wool fibers of felt could be used as the curing agent, leading to the pair's experiments which proved fruitful.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \nJohnson and Monteith have designed and made over forty small vessels, but the first five took three and a half years.&amp;nbsp; First Monteith turned a variety of bowl forms in his woodworking shop; then Johnson created her felt over these molds.&amp;nbsp; The modeling over the molds created a felt strong enough to serve as a mold, replacing the usual cotton or hemp substrate for the lacquering process.&amp;nbsp; Once formed, the felt vessels are firm but flexible enough that Monteith could distort the forms to give them their organic quality, while applying and sanding the fifty to seventy-five layers of lacquer.&amp;nbsp; The fuzz of the wool fibers standing off the surface of the felt acts as a scaffold giving the lacquer greater strength and integrity. The lacquer, in turn, provides the felt with new textures. The combination of the two techniques provides contrast and strength while producing a visually appealing design.\nMonteith calls the result &quot;mother nature's fiberglass&quot;.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it is an ingenious use at two age-old techniques mingled in a new and reactive way to produce an organic design object.&amp;nbsp; \nWinged Vessel II exemplifies the guiding role materials can play in the creation of a new design. It is a good example of two highly skilled craftsmen, who also are designers, working together to innovate in the use of materials.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",
