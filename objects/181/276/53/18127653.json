A first design of the pediment has been made invalid. Below, the scheme is the same as above. The window frame is surrounded by a panel with pillars laterally supporting an entablature, straight above the capitals then curved upward. On top is a pointed pediment with a sphere upon a base above the straight part. In front of the keystone is a female head with drapery hanging down.",
