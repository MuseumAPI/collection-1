    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification: \n&quot;Context: While originally not trained as product designers, Fernando is an architect and Humberto studied law, the Campana brothers have become one of the most important and innovative design teams working today.&amp;nbsp; Their use of materials, in particular, has been a hallmark of their design practice.&amp;nbsp; Often evoking the rich street-market culture of their native Brazil, they utilize quotidian products in unexpected ways, such as the use of cord to create opulent pile upholstery in the Vermelha chair.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They continue to transform materials into objects, culminating in their recent &quot;Transplastic&quot; exhibition in London, where they utilized traditional caning techniques to transform basic plastic caf\u00e9 chair\nThe Chair: In conjunction with the Campana brothers' upcoming Selects exhibition at Cooper-Hewitt, the curators are eager to acquire an example of their furniture design work.&amp;nbsp; They are not represented in the furniture collection, and the inclusion of the Vermelha chair would greatly enhance Cooper-Hewitt's modern design holdings and would relate thematically to their Selects exhibition.&amp;nbsp; The only other example of their work in the collection is a tabletop object (approved at the last collection committee meeting), and designers of their talent and range should be represented in several media.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
