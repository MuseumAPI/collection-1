    "justification": "The Nest Learning Thermostat has been called the \u201ciPod of thermostats\u201d\u2014perhaps because its creators, alumni of Apple, were leaders in creating the iPod and early iPhones. The thermostat may do for home energy what the iPod did for portable music-playing: revolutionize it. \nThe thermostat, Nest Labs\u2019s first product, officially went on sale in November 2011. The company began taking preorders in late October, 2011 and sold out within 72 hours.<b> <\/b>According to the social media news and blog website, Mashable, 90% of programmable thermostats are \u201crarely or never programmed,\u201d and the sleek design and automatic features of Nest\u2019s device could improve those numbers.\nThe temperature is depicted in bold numbers, front and center, on the large circular face within a simple circular matt stainless steel housing. Functionality is based around a ring, similar to that of the iPod. Moving your finger around the outer ring changes the temperature\u2014the thermostat face turns blue when it is cooling, and red when heating; pressing the ring provides access to all of the thermostat\u2019s settings. \nUsers must initially program the thermostat themselves in the morning, evening, or when they are out of the house, but it eventually remembers their patterns and reverts to self-programming. The device can also detect if anyone is in the room, and adjust the temperature accordingly. &amp;nbsp;Additional features include the ability to control home temperature on the go\u2014from a laptop, smartphone, or tablet\u2014automatic software updates, security features, and a green leaf icon that appears when the device is set to an energy-saving level.&amp;nbsp; The Nest thermostat uses technology from across a range of industries: sensors from the medical industry, electronics from smartphones, software from the open-source community, and learning technology.\nThermostats control half of a home\u2019s energy uses, and are responsible for 10% of U.S. energy consumption. There are a quarter-billion thermostats in the U.S. and another ten million are purchased each year. However, according to Nest co-founder Matt Rogers, the \u201ceyesore\u201d cream-colored-plastic-box thermostat had not changed much in the past twenty years. Rogers, with co-founder Tony Fadell, aimed to turn the thermostat into a better-functioning and better-looking object that people would actually want to interact with, and that would lower energy usage and heating\/cooling bills.\nNest Labs is revolutionizing what seems to be a forgotten industry, in part to reduce energy consumption and benefit the environment. The company is also part of a new wave of designers. In an interview with Mashable, Rogers compared Nest Labs to Dyson, known for its vacuum cleaners: James Dyson took an uninteresting, unsexy product and made it work and look better, creating a successful company in the process.&amp;nbsp; \n<a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/10\/25\/ipod-designer-thermostat\/\">http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/10\/25\/ipod-designer-thermostat\/<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/12\/15\/nest-labs-interview\/\">http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/12\/15\/nest-labs-interview\/<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/01\/technology\/personaltech\/nest-learning-thermostat-sets-a-standard-david-pogue.html?_r=0\">http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/12\/01\/technology\/personaltech\/nest-learning-thermostat-sets-a-standard-david-pogue.html?_r=0<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nest.com\">www.nest.com<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/reviews.cnet.com\/2300-17889_7-10014005-6.html\">http:\/\/reviews.cnet.com\/2300-17889_7-10014005-6.html<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nest.com\/blog\/2012\/03\/21\/the-nest-store-is-open\/\">http:\/\/www.nest.com\/blog\/2012\/03\/21\/the-nest-store-is-open\/<\/a>VIDEO: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nest.com\/living-with-nest\/#meet-the-nest-learning-thermostat\">http:\/\/www.nest.com\/living-with-nest\/#meet-the-nest-learning-thermostat<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2011\/10\/nest_thermostat\/\">http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2011\/10\/nest_thermostat\/<\/a>",
