    "description": "One layer of a knitted fabric is stretched under tension. A layer of polyester chiffon is layered on top. An adhesive is screen printed on in a pattern, permeating both fabric layers. Rayon fibers are sprinkled on and made to stand up as pile using an electric charge (flocking). The tension is released on the lower layer of fabric, causing the chiffon layer to pucker all around the flocked motifs. (a) is black with light green chiffon and black flocking; (b) is black with white chiffon and tan flocking.",
    "justification": "Yoshihiro Kimura (b. 1947, Kyoto) is part of the first generation of contemporary Japanese textile designers who in the 1980s were interested in experimenting with and modifying traditional techniques and fibers to make innovative fabrics. In Pedocal, for example, Kimura combines seemingly disparate material to create an entirely new surface.&amp;nbsp; He affixes polyester chiffon to a base of stretched knitted fabric.&amp;nbsp; An acrylic binder screen-printed in a pattern permeates the fabrics, causing them to join.&amp;nbsp; Rayon fibers are affixed to this binder, and using an electric charge (flocking), are made to stand vertically.&amp;nbsp; The knitted fabric that had been stretched during this whole process is loosened again, leaving the double-layered cloth puckered and covered with flocked crevices.Like many in his field, Kimura comes from a textile family.&amp;nbsp; After graduating from Toyama University, he worked in his father's textile business which would later&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; specialize in flock printing.&amp;nbsp; They have diversified to include other printing techniques using resin and pigment.&amp;nbsp; He has worked with such well-known designers as Kansai Yamamoto and Issey Miyake.",
