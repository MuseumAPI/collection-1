    "gallery_text": "Invented in Europe just before 1300, the mechanical clock was for centuries a rarefied symbol of wealth and power. By the nineteenth century, several Connecticut inventors, including Eli Terry, were producing less expensive timepieces for the growing middle class. But it was Terry who effectively advanced clock making from craft to factory process. Known as the \"American system,\" water-powered machinery mass-produced uniform, interchangeable wooden timepiece parts, rather than expensive brass, In 1816 Terry devised this distinctly American mantel clock, smaller than traditional tall clocks, with a simple wooden box case and a glass door bearing reverse-painted dial numbers. In 1823, after a series of refinements, Terry patented a version of this clock, a wooden, weight-driven, hour-striking device known as the \"Connecticut pillar-and-scroll clock.\". Terry\u2019s immediate success spawned imitators eager to capture the lower-cost clock market. Low-cost clocks played a significant role in transforming the rural North, setting the industrial revolution in motion.",
    "label_text": "In early nineteenth-century America, clock-making changed from a craft to a factory process, in which machines mass-produced uniform, interchangeable parts. The desire was to make low-cost domestic clocks as economically as possible. This device\u2019s case is an austere wooden box, whose glass door, with its reverse-painted numbers, serves as a dial.",
