  "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating four sketches of architectural details or ornament.  At top left is the octagonal cupola of a cathedral tower with louvered openings on two levels, capped by a dome with dormers and a finial.  To the right is a bird of prey clutching a snake or serpent in its claws standing on a ball finial.  Below this is the top of a clock tower with a trio of bells hung from an ironwork structure above.  Two scrolling brackets decorate the ironwork on either side.  Below left is another tower with an octagonal cupola though here with an ogee curve and a cross at the apex.",
