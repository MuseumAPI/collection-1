    "description": "Scrolling vines with red and blue flowers, including tulips and carnations, on a cream-colored ground. Emphasis is given to the forms of the flowers by leaving a very narrow white space between the edge of the petals and the outlines. Piece is seamed across center. Lower section shows evidence of a border at the right side. \n\nWhite cotton, on which a strongly curved vine appears, from which spring various large flowers.  The foliage is now blue as the yellow has diappeared.  Blossoms in reds, pink: some show details of a gray-violet.  Drawing is heavy, bold, emphatic; flowers seen in profile are realistically drawn; naturalistic veining in leaves.  Emphasis is given the forms of flowers by a trick of leaving a very narrow white space between the edge of petals and the outlines, which are sometimes red, sometimes brown.  Among the flowers the tulip and carnation are identifiable. \nColors: Two shades of red, pink, blue, a gray violet (faded purple), brown and red for outlines.",
