His right arm extended to the left of the drawing to a group of three figures gathered around a man on the ground. Behind them a group of figures with a rider with his back turned.  On the right of the drawing a larger group of  soldiers and horses, struggling.  The foreground shows three groupings of wounded and killed. \r\n\r\n",
