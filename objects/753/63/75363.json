The spaces are filled with birds, flowering plants, and verses. In the upper left and right corners, pairs of angels hold wreaths encircling the initials E and T. Surrounded on four sides by a carnation border.\r\n\r\nThe verse reads: \r\nGod counts the sorrows of his saints\r\nTheir groans affect his ears \r\nHe has a book for their complaints \r\nA bottle for their tears",
