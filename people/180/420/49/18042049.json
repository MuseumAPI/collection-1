    "biography": "Frank Lloyd Wright (American, 1867 - 1959) was an architect, designer, educator and writer. A proponent of what he termed organic architecture, Wright designed over a thousand structures and strove to create buildings that were in harmony with their surroundings and humanity. His work included innovative examples of many building types, such as homes, churches, schools, offices, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also designed many of the interior elements and fittings of his buildings, as well as much of the furniture for those interiors. In 1991, the American Institute of Architects named Wright the \"greatest American architect of all time.\"",
