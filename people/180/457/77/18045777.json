    "biography": "Rosita Missoni is an acclaimed fashion designer and proprietor of the acclaimed Missoni fashion brand. Rosita came from a family of shawl and embroidered fabric producers. After marrying her husband Ottavio Missoni, the couple began making knit sweaters and dresses on the machines her family used to make shawls and bedspreads. They developed surprisingly lightweight yet sumptuous knits, which soon became the hallmark of the Missoni brand. Rosita and Ottavio opened a knitwear studio in the 1940s and she became the creative director. Drawing from folk art, Rosita was influenced by bold colors and mixed patterns. By 1955, the Missoni brand was launched and in the following years it became a household name known for their colorful knitwear designs. The Missoni\u2019s have been immensely involved within the international fashion scene, in the early 1970s they helped create Milan Fashion Week. By the early 1990s, Rosita no longer was interested in fashion and was succeeded by her daughter, Angela. Missoni remains one of the most widely recognized couture brands worldwide.",
