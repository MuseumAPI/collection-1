  "description": "Frieze of drapery, urns, classic-revival architectural ornament. Beige ground divided into horizontal bandings by brown and blue molding, horizontal pointed elipses with floral and foliate ornamentation, and groupings of parallel lines and geometric shapes. Frieze dominated by draped swags, bright blue, above which are blue urns and which appear draped from small round-ended panels with flower centers. Panels top vertical banding of browns which interrupts horizontals of rest of the ground.",
