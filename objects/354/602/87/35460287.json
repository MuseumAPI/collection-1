    "description": "In the form of an Italian Renaissance hexagonal chapel with domed roof above two stories of windows within pediments on columns.",
    "justification": "This extraordinary model of a temple is close to many late Renaissance examples, but was executed in 1782, probably in Venice.&amp;nbsp; It is dedicated to Pope Pius the VI, clearly as a special commission.&amp;nbsp; The execution of the very sophisticated carved and veneered ivory on wood is of excellent skill and the proportions are those of the late sixteenth century. It carries out its hexagonal shape from the base up to the gallery and on to the drum that supports the dome, which has oculi windows.&amp;nbsp; Made by both a great model maker who was possibly also an architect, this model sums up many treatises on architectural refinement of the Renaissance in its execution, shape and design.",
