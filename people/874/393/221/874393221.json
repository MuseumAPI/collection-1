    "biography": "Jeweler and sculptor Anton Cepka was born in 1936 in the Czechoslovakian, now Slovakian, town of \u0160ulekovo. After attending the Bratislava School of Arts and Crafts, he studied under jewelry artist Jan Nu\u0161l and sculptor Alena Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 at Prague\u2019s Academy of Applied Arts. His interests in art, technology, and architecture has informed his work since the beginning of his career.\n\nIn 1964, not long after starting in his occupation, Cepka received the Bavarian State Award for his work at the Internationale Handwerksmesse (International Crafts Fair) in Munich. In 1968, he participated in an international jewelry symposium in Jablonec and Nisou. Though he always focused on clarity and form in his artwork, his style evolved in the mid-1970s to include organic forms. Throughout his career, Cepka\u2019s work has reflected the influence of Constructivism in its fascination with the technological world and modern modes of production.\n\nCepka is both an educator and an artist who thinks of his jewelry pieces as sculptural compositions rather than adornment. Because of his unique work, that combined essential tenets of Constructivism with ephemeral sensibilities of dynamism and light in the post-war era, he is heralded as the leading figure of Czech and Slovakian jewelry design.",
