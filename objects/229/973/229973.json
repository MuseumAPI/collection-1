  "description": "While this vicarage library is typically Victorian in stye, it incorporates elements of the Aesthetic movement. The circular table covered with a blue velvet cloth, scrap screen on the left and floral-patterned carpet are common to late nineteenth century vicarages. However, the pale gray walls and white-matted watercolors above the bookcase show Aesthetic leanings.",
