    "gallery_text": "This silk fragment was woven in fifteenth century Islamic Spain. Textiles of this style first appeared in the late fourteenth century, and their production continued even after the fall of the Nasrids \u2013 Spain\u2019s last Muslim dynasty \u2013 in 1492. Similar examples abound in museum collections today, meaning that fabric of this type was widely produced and distributed. They share an overall arrangement of wide horizontal bands separated by narrower bands of varying widths. The patterning of the wider bands often was inspired by other forms Nasrid decoration such as the stuccowork and tile designs found in the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. In this example, Kufic inscriptions read \"success and prosperity\" and \"beatitude.\" The eight-pointed stars, merlons, and delicate strapwork seen in this fragment are common motifs as well. The coloration is predominantly red, green and yellow with yellow silk thread substituting for the gold metallic thread used in the past.",
