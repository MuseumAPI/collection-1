The Trans... chair is shown in front and back elevations, side elevation and in three-quarter axonometric view. Vividly colored shapes correspond to the placement of plastic and rubber elements woven into the fabric of the chair. Wicker construction is suggested by loose, cross-hatched orange lines.",
