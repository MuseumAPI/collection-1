Above is a terrace bordered by balustrades, with statues at the protruding corners, six of which are drawn: three representing warriors, one that seems to be a figure of the Italian comedy, with colors; two others. Upon the balustrade are two men; one of them bears a mask. Through the arch, a view of a structure with a large niche, in front of which stands a statue, evidently of \"POSEIDON.\" The floor of the whole place is paved. Framing line.",
