    "description": "A field exhibiting three date palms with feathery heads, one crossing stem of the tallest and a border of a flowering vine. The palms rise from a mound or hillocks naturalistically rendered and shades in red, green, brown and some purple and yellow. Small bamboos riese from its corners. The trunks of the palms are purple, outlined in black, and they show a scaly or imbricated surface. Vines with red stems creep up around the palm bearing small flowers in red, violet, and other colors which fill the background. A very narrow border divides the main field from a border about ten inches wide decorated with curving vine, like bamboo, with red and green leaves, fruits and flowers. A wide border, about seventeen inches, at sides and eight inches at the bottom have been added and are European, probably French, block printed coton on a deep cream ground. Flowers are small, in shades of red, blue, green and brown in typical, small flower patterns of block printing from the second half of the eighteenth century. The quilt is lined with a rather coarse material, probably heavy linen, block printed in large scale designs of large red flower and meander on broken black ground. The material in unbleached and is in three and half breadths. The additions were made in Europe, France probably, and quilted. The quilting line crossing the palampore and the added French border. The stuffing is cotton.",
