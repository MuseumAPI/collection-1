    "description":"Tea caddy in the form of a nineteenth century Gothic-Tudor style half-timbered house with numerous chimneys, the roof lifting to reveal 2 tea caddies and one glass mixing bowl.",
    "justification":"This house-form tea caddy represents the increasingly broad market for tea in nineteenth-century England, combined with the fashion for medieval and Tudor architecture, some of which was called&amp;nbsp; &quot;Shavian Queen Anne&quot;.&amp;nbsp; So named for Richard Norman Shaw, the architect who popularized larger houses combining Tudor and other later elements, this style had little to do with early eighteenth- century Queen Anne architecture, but brought nineteenth-century scale to historic styles. The&amp;nbsp;half-timbered style was&amp;nbsp;used by Liberty and Company for its&amp;nbsp;Regent Street&amp;nbsp;shop&amp;nbsp;during this era, and it was a purveyor of many tea accessories. &amp;nbsp; The tea caddy house has a roof that lifts to reveal two compartments for tea, a common practice in more elegant eighteenth-century tea caddies in England.&amp;nbsp; This enabled the owner to show the sophistication of having two types of tea and mixing them to taste or time of day. The glass bowl inside was for mixing the teas, and is original.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While tea had been a very expensive import during the eighteenth century, increasing amounts of trade by the East India company and increased wealth in Britain due to the industrial revolution and trade enabled a broad spectrum of people to enjoy tea.",
