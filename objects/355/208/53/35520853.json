    "justification": "Eighteen drawings by the artist Forrest Myers (b. 1941) are being offered as a gift to Cooper-Hewitt from Marc Benda of Friedman Benda Gallery. These are divided into two groups: nine designs for tables and nine for chairs. Though primarily a sculptor of anodized wire pieces, Myers maintains that he has long been interested in the connection of sculpture and furniture. This area of exploration led him to create a stool in 1964, called Tendu, which leaned to one side. He returned to furniture around 1980 when he designed the Cut-Out Chair and Fold Chair which led to his first solo exhibition at New York's Art et Industrie Gallery in 1981. The eighteen sketches most likely date from this time because of their similarity to tables and chairs that were shown in the 1981 exhibition. The sketches for chairs show nine different concepts, each made of one piece of folded aluminum thereby eliminating any soldering of separate elements. The nine concepts for tables represent different ideas for round, rectangular, and oval tables with various aluminum-formed bases.",
