  "description": "The palace was built in 1747-1752 in Portugal by Mateus Vicente de Oliveira (1706-1786) for the Infante Dom Pedro in homage to Versailles.  The bedroom of the Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil (the King's Bedroom) represents a remarkable example of Rococo decoration.  The circular room is decorated by Manoel da Costa with episodes from the story of Don Quixote. Da Costa was influenced by the French Rococo designer, Jean Pillement.  A rendering of Apollo and the Muses is partially seen on the ceiling.  The bed is draped in the French style; however, the rest of the furniture appears to be English.  The radiating patterned floor is probably of Brazilian hardwood.",
