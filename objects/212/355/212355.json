  "description": "Three horizontal silver sections with block lettering in German, French and English advertising the 1976 Jewelry Exhibition at the Swiss Industrie Fair.  Each of the sectionsfollows an identical composition based entirely on the layout of the typography.  In each, the word for Jewelry (Les Bijoux and Schmuch) is presented in solid black large block letters at the left balanced by black rectangled at right.  Compositional variants appear in the German text block: the exhibition layout section is punctuated by black circles while the identical sections in the English and French sections employ rectangles and squares, respectively.  The silver and black sections are strikingly set off against the yellow boarders of the paper support.",
