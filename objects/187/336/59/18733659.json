    "justification": "These six window shades were created for the theatre in the Hollywood Wing of Duke Farms in Hillsborough, NJ.&amp;nbsp; The original house dates to 1893 and was the home of James Buchanan Duke who made his wealth in tobacco and hydroelectric power.&amp;nbsp; He gained a competitive edge by being the first person to successfully use machines to roll cigarettes.&amp;nbsp; The Hollywood Wing was added by daughter Doris Duke in 1938-39.&amp;nbsp; The theatre was designed by Thomas W. Lamb, (1871-1942) one of the foremost theatre and cinema architects during the late19th - early 20th century.&amp;nbsp; He designed many of the most well-known theatres in New York City and across the country including the Ziegfield Theatre, 1927, Madison Square Garden, 1925, and the Academy of Music (later the Palladium Theatre) in 1927.&amp;nbsp; The window shades are hand painted on canvas. &amp;nbsp;\nThe theme of the six shades is music and dance which are all rendered in an art deco\/cubist style.&amp;nbsp; Each shade contains a central figure which portrays a different country or region including Africa, China, Switzerland, Hawaii, Mexico and Russia.&amp;nbsp; Each of the figures is surrounded by elements of folk tradition mixed with historic elements specific to that country or region.&amp;nbsp; This portrayal of the different regions is inspired by the classic four continents theme which included Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.",
