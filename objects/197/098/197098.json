  "description": "A photographic image of a man, his head cut off above the mouth and his right side cut off at the shoulder, occupies almost the entire space from left to right and slightly more than half the page from top to bottom. Wearing evening dress, he is seated at a table covered in a white cloth. In his right hand, he holds a fork suspended over a plate covered by food. An additional fork is set near his left hand, which rests on the table, and a knife is set to the right of the plate. A butter dish near the tip of the knife and a partial view of a smaller plate near the left hand complete the table setting. The names of six food and drink items, imprinted in white on the man's left side black tuxedo front , are followed by instructions for removing stains that may be caused by those foods. Thin diagonal lines preceding the names extend into the white shirtfront, the ostensible field for potential stains. Unoccupied tables in the background indicate a restaurant setting. Below the dinner plate, the name, Restaurant Florent, and other identifying information complete the design.",
