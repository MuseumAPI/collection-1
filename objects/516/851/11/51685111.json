    "justification": "The British arts and crafts movement featured the clarity of silver with colored elements either in stone or enamel, and this piece is illustrative of that aesthetic as well as of the elongated proportions that defined many of the objects at the turn of the twentieth century. An important and influential design, this&amp;nbsp;model of dish&amp;nbsp;is depicted and described in Alan Crawford, C. R. Ashbee: Architect, Designer &amp; Romantic Socialist, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1985, pp. 334-7. Also depicted as item 41 in Karlsruhe Jugendstil. This model was exhibited in the 1902 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative Arts in Turin. A variant is depicted and described as item 280 in Le Arti Decorative Internazionali del Nuovo Secolo, the catalog for the exhibition celebrating the centennial of the exhibition in Torino, 1902.",
