  "description": "The subject's wavy hair is brushed back from the forehead and cascades down to the shoulders. The right brow, slanting upward, forms an unbroken line with the nose on the same side; the left brow slants upward as well. The eyelids are lowered, but the left one opens slightly to reveal the eye. The lips are slightly parted; the upper lip is narrow and the lower full. A thickened line forms under the chin, and shading is emphasized in the right cheek and at the hairline.",
