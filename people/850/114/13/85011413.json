    "biography": "Yeongkyu Yoo designs pure, clarified objects. He omits superfluous decoration to emphasize an object\u2019s function, resulting in elegant forms suggestive of the work of Japanese designer Kenya Hara. After having worked for companies including Nike, iriver, and Samsung, Yoo established cloudandco in 2010 as a design firm to deliver his simple, pared-down aesthetic to a commercial market. Yoo also provides creative direction for industrial design as part of the Microsoft New Devices team. In this role, Yoo helps oversee the headset, packaging, and accessory design of Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens (expected soon), illustrating his talent in clarifying complex technology with simple, user-centered design.",
