  "description": "Lightly drawn, the head is in right profile and tilted downward. Either a full head of shoulder length hair, swept back off the face, or a perhaps a headdress in an antique style, falls behind the left shoulder. A series of curved lines below the neck and ending at the waist, delineates the sleeveless garment, perhaps also in an antique style. The arms, abbreviated above the elbows, extend out to the sides.",
