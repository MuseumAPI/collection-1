    "description": "Poster for the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation. \"Jonathan Jones\" is printed across three registers on blue ground. \"Jon \/ ath \/ an\" is printed in white type which slants to the left. These letters intersect with the black letters spelling \"Jo \/ ne \/ s,\" which slant to the right.",
    "justification": "This poster was designed to advertise a solo exhibition of the work of Jonathan Jones, a Sydney-based Aboriginal artist who is from the Kamilaroi\/Wiradjuri nations located in South Eastern Australia.  His work in sculpture and installation features fluorescent tubes and incandescent bulbs, often arranged in patterns that have their origins in the Kamilaroi\/Wiradjuri traditions.  His exhibition at Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, \u201cUntitled (the tyranny of distance)\u201d showcased a piece with fluorescent lights enclosed in blue tarpaulin.  For his design, Gowing adopted the colors, light and shade of Jones\u2019 artwork and created a typeface that draws on the angular lines of the fluorescent tubes, while referencing early experiments in Soviet Constructivist typography.",
