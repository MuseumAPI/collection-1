  "description": "In the upper half of the page, just left of center, is the head of a female turning right. The dark, full eyes glance right; the full lips are closed; the eyelids, left side of the forehead and lower left of the face are heavily shaded, thus highlighting the white space of the middle part of the face. On the lower left of the page is a design for a low table, its two tiers connected by straight-lined vertical fixtures. Sketches of various objects, including a stoppered bottle in the upper half, right, complete the page.",
