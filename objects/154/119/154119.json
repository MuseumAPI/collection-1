  "description": "The present design for a silk fabric shows a pattern of small motor/sail boats, in alternating positions of right side up and upside down.  Each boat carries a skull and bones flag, alluding perhaps to rum-running, as the business of pirated liquor was known..  The Volstead Act (1920) and the related Eighteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution established the prohibition of alcohol in the U. S. The design probably refers to the repeal of prohibition in 1933 by the Twenty-First Amendment.",
