    "justification": "In 2012, the design team Experimental Jetset created the graphic identity for the exhibition \u201cPlayboy Architecture, 1952-1979\u201d at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa, an architecture institute in Maastricht, The Netherlands.&amp;nbsp; The exhibition looked at influence of Playboy Magazine on architecture and design, and was curated by the M+M (Media and Modernity) Program at the Princeton University School of Architecture.&amp;nbsp; Experimental Jetset took the iconic bunny logo of Playboy and cropped and rotated it, creating a \u201cmulti-eyed entity\u201d that alluded to the exhibitions themes.&amp;nbsp; The designers chose to print some of the text in pink, a reference to the \u201cnotion of flesh,\u201d but also \u201can attempt to somewhat undermine the \u2018machismo\u2019 of the subject of the exhibition.&amp;nbsp; After all,\u201d the designers have noted, \u201cpink is often seen as an effeminate colour.\u201d&amp;nbsp; The design was altered to suit three different formats: a large, poster screenprinted by Wyber Zeefdruk was used to advertise the exhibition outdoors.&amp;nbsp; A smaller poster, offset-printed by Lenoirschuring, advertised the exhibition indoors.&amp;nbsp; A folder pamphlet served as an invitation.",
