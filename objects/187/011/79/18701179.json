    "justification":"From the Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;This plate is a very fine example of Russian Imperial porcelain. This example was produced for the Kremlin service. The service was ordered by Nicholas I to the designs of Professor Th. Solntsev who held an important position in the Imperial sponsored movement of rediscovering and reinterpreting of old Russian forms.&amp;nbsp; Solntsev drew upon 17th century metalwork as the model for this service, making use in particular of a gold dish made in 1667 for the Tsarina Natalia Kirilovna (see Russian Enamels, XI-XIX Centuries, Moscow, 1974, pl. 61). The Grand Kremlin Palace was built by the architect K.A. Thon (1794-1881), with a brief from the Tsar to create a building in the Russian style showing also the influence of Byzantium.&amp;nbsp; It was for this new-Russian setting that the Kremlin service was designed. The plate has a specifically Russian design featuring the Imperial eagle surrounded by a Cyrillic inscription (translation: Nicholas the Emperor and Ruler of All the Russias) on a richly decorated surface.&quot;",
