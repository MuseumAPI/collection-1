    "gallery_text": "This charming salad bowl design \u2013 created by Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Micaud \u2013 offers a cabbage leaf shape, which became typical of French S\u00e8vres porcelainware in the mid 1700\u2019s. It also illustrates how tableware became use-specific in 18th-century France. Micaud, who entered the S\u00e8vres Manufacture at the age of twenty-two, was specialized in floral decorations. This design is no exception, produced at the beginning of his carrier in the manufacture. The elevation and plan emphasize the intricate patterning for which S\u00e8vres was famous, including sprays of roses, tulips, colored daisies, and blue and yellow-brown painted scallops on the edges. The ornate floral bouquets and polychromatic decoration are proportionally reduced for this bowl, leaving much of the space white and hence giving an overall impression of balance, delicacy and grace.",
