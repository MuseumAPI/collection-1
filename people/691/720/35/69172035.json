    "biography": "A fourth-generation member of the Fendi family, Delfina Delettrez creates designs that seek new ideas about jewelry and beauty for her generation. Delettrez\u2019s often-surrealist jewels reappropriate items that are deliberately odd, ugly, or taboo\u2014sex, poisonous insects, bones, anatomy\u2014as fantastical inspiration, set in luxury materials and finishes. Delettrez\u2019s more recent work centers on adornment that appears to float on the body. Phantom settings are used to mount pearls on rings and earrings. And earrings are sold singly, suggesting the wearer adorn themselves with just one (or a mismatched pair), as though leaving the house sloppily clad and half-dressed, a subversion of conventional beauty ideals.",
