    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Swiss industrial designer Yves B\u00e9har, age 43, was the 2004 CHNDM National Design Award winner in the category of Product Design.&amp;nbsp; Based in San Francisco, he and the firm he founded in 1999, fuseproject, have become recognized for designing objects based on conceptual narrative inspired by the user's experience, and for blending design and brand development.&amp;nbsp; B\u00e9har is a versatile designer, who is at ease experimenting with new concepts, clients, materials, and technologies. He has produced a wide spectrum of work, as can be seen in the range of his designs shown in Cooper-Hewitt's exhibition celebrating the tenth anniversary of the National Design Awards, Design USA: Contemporary Innovation, which includes B\u00e9har's luxurious chandelier for Swarovski, combining crystal with contemporary lighting technology, along with his Mini_motion watch, a product that exemplifies his dedication to creating&amp;nbsp; design for the mass market. \nIn 2001, automobile manufacturer MINI commissioned B\u00e9har to develop accessories around the Cooper, a car the company was reintroducing 43 years after its debut. Instead of resorting to key rings and similar objects as logo-based status symbols, B\u00e9har created the MINI_motion group of highly practical objects and apparel intended to appeal not just to MINI owners, but to consumers who wanted to experience the brand in terms of design and utility in or out of a car. The simple, minimal form of the MINI_motion watch emphasizes B\u00e9har's intent to create &quot;\u2026functionality around the notion of movement, accentuating [a] sporty yet designed feel\u2026.&quot; The watch features a large digital LCD display that can be changed from vertically oriented numbers to larger horizontal numerals with the push of one of the small function buttons flanking the display. This facilitates readability when positioning the arm for different activities such as holding a steering wheel while driving, grasping handlebars while riding a bicycle, or simply walking. The wide cuff-like spring steel wristband is open at one end making it easy to slip the watch on and off, its soft rubber covering making it comfortable against the skin. The watch shows B\u00e9har's concern with function and ease of use, rather than appearance as the primary design factor.&quot;",
