The original paper was found in the old house of Joseph Lord, great grandfather of Katherine Ludington in Old Lyme, CT. Design is of \"Minerva\" with shield and mace with a serpent at her feet. At either end  are festooned columns. One has a cannon on top and the other, an amoured vest. Above these motifs is an urn filled with flowers. Printed in blue, henna and ivory on blue field.",
