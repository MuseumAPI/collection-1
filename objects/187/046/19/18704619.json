    "description": "Large-scale engineered print of a branch in misty white with multiple colors in the leaves. The background is an academic paper on digital printing for textiles in yellow on orange.",
    "justification": "Hitoshi Ujiie is a textile designer as well as educator and founder of the Center for Excellence in Digital Inkjet Printing at Philadelphia University. Ujiie's work is an exploration of the aesthetic implications of digital inkjet printing for textiles, which is bringing about profound changes in the approach to design for this medium.   \nWorking from photographic and video sources combined with hand manipulation, Ujiie exploits the full range of effects that can be achieved by digital technology, yet his work maintains a profoundly delicate aesthetic. Digital technology permits a fineness of line not previously possible due to the higher &quot;resolution&quot; of inkjet as opposed to screen printing. It also eliminates the need for repeat in textile design, and Ujiie turns his attention instead to a sense of movement without repetition. This can be achieved through randomization of pattern over extended lengths or through large-scale engineered prints such as Branch, which has a 10-foot high motif as well as an extended academic treatise on inkjet technologies printed continuously in the background. The subtle tonal gradation and sense of transparency typical of Ujiie's work and showcased in Branch is only possible with inkjet technology. While it is theoretically possible to print millions of colors with a four-color printing process, Ujiie uses this color precision instead in the creation of layered dimensional effects and subtle color blending.",
