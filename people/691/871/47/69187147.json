    "biography": "Ruth Gurvich is a Paris-based artist who works with ceramic and paper painted with acrylic paint. Her art is based on an exploration of the cultural codes of artistic production. Gurvich studies the relationship between space and volume. She looks at everyday objects including chairs and porcelain objects and reproduces them as three-dimensional paper models to experiment with their volume. Sometimes Gurvich rearranges these objects to make them two-dimensional, creating a new perspective on the items which retain their original volume. Gurvich studied at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the School of Fine Arts at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina. She has exhibited her work extensively in Paris and throughout Europe and at international contemporary art fairs.",
