    "biography": "Ana Lisa Hedstrom grew up in Detroit and received her B.A. in Art from Mills College in Oakland, California. She is best known for her signature textiles based on contemporary adaptations of Japanese dyeing. Hedstrom takes an interpretive approach to textiles combining the Japanese arashi shibori technique with digital scanning. Hedstrom continuously surprises with her bold and seductive fabrics. Hand-dyeing each piece to make them unique, she embraces Eastern and Western traditions, cutting and folding the cloth for her specific needs. Hedstrom has taught and lectured at numerous international schools and shibori conferences. Additionally she has received several awards, and her work has been widely exhibited and published.",
