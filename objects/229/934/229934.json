  "description": "In this drawing of the study in the Chateau de Neuilly, the summer residence of King Louis-Philippe, he is seated at his writing table, piles of documents at his side. Swagged draperies in the Empire style frame the windows, which look out on the park at Neuilly. Except for the large number of paintings lining the walls, this is a typical working study of the time, an almost middle-class room.",
