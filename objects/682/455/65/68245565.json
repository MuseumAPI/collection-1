    "justification": "Brooches seem to have been one of&amp;nbsp;Horner\u2019s most successful products. They have been called some of the best mass-produced jewelry of the early 20th century. While stylistically, they most clearly are influenced by Liberty-simplified Cymric, they had a greater breadth of style.&amp;nbsp; Some of the designsare extremely similar to ones Liberty made. It is possible that some of Liberty\u2019s designs were executed by or specifically for them by the Horner firm. Otherwise, it may be that Horner skillfully adapted a handmade style to one that could be more cost-effectively produced.\n&amp;nbsp;No design authorship is claimed anywhere on drawings or in catalogues for any of the designs the firm produced. However, the most Art Nouveau pieces were produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most Art Nouveau-style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. It also&amp;nbsp;indicates that the assay markings for Chester are most likely to be just where the silver was assayed and not a place the pieces were made. The fact that the firm had a wholesale&amp;nbsp;enterprise in Birmingham, where the center of the jewelry trade was&amp;nbsp;and they could have had&amp;nbsp;the pieces assayed there, however, does indicate there may have been other reasons to use Chester. \nWhile most of the jewelry was mass-produced, using silver wire, ribbon or formed into swirls, circles and other shapes, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand and most was made in the basse-taille \u2013or shallow-cut- technique.&amp;nbsp; This technique involves cutting through engraving or chasing silver with bas-relief patterns and covering that in translucent enamel. Rich tonal qualities are achieved by varying the amounts of engraving and depth of enamel. \nFor both pendants and brooches in this collection, they would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.\n&amp;nbsp;",
