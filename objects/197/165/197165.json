  "description": "The present object's design bows to those traditional commercial wall calendars of an earlier time distributed by businesses to customers. Rolled and enclosed in a wrapper for mailing, the calendar has a black plastic strip with a central hanger at the top and is meant to be unrolled for hanging.\r\n\r\nThe layout of each of the twelve pages is comprised of four rectangular sections bordered in red. The top section, approximately one third of the page in length, is headed M&Co., centered, in bold, black, sans serif type. Aligned with the vertical center of the heading are, on the left, Words, and on the right, Pictures, imprinted in small, bold, serif style red type. Directly underneath the heading, a red line stretches across, accompanied on either side by a red square, appearing as if the line had been broken. \"For All Your Design Needs\" in black sans serif capitals is imprinted directly below the line. A black and white illustration of the front and adjoining one side of the West 17th Street building in Manhattan where M&Co was located at the time is reproduced in the center below this second line of type. The street number, 50, appears twice above the doors in the illustration and 50 W. 17 St./ in New York City/ Home of M&Co is imprinted in black capitals underneath.  On the left, the company's services are listed in four groups of three indented lines each, imprinted in red italics. On the right, the telephone number, displaying the exchange name in the alphabetical, rather than numerical, form, is imprinted in red; an icon of a shield, composed of vertical stripes and imprinted AIGA, is imprinted below in black, followed underneath by four lines in red capitals citing M&Co's expertise in the language of an earlier era. The three additional rectangular sections feature a three-month sequence consisting of the prior, current, and following months, continuing in that order to the bottom of the page; all type is serif style. The rectangle containing the current month, identical in size to the titular section, shows the month, Sundays, holidays, and phases of the moon in red, and the year, as well as the remaining days of the week and numerals, in black. The two other sections, smaller and of equal size, are imprinted in black on a pink background. \"M & Co.\" - Over 6 Years of Dependable Service appears in black sans serif capitals just above the bottom edge of the page.\r\n\r\nWrapper: On the left, Printed Matter/ To Open/ Pull Thread is imprinted in red; an arrow to the left of the directions points upward toward the black thread. (Now that the object has been opened, the thread is no longer present.)",
