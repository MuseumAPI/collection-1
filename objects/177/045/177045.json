Surrounded by a flowering vine border on all sides. \r\nThe verse reads: \r\nPoor, weak and sinful though I am \r\nI have a rich Almighty Friend\r\nJesus the Saviour is His name\r\nHe freely loves, and without end\r\n\r\nHe found me wandering far from God\r\nAnd brought me to his chosen fold\r\nRedeemed me with His precious blood\r\nAnd with His power my foes controlled\r\n\r\nHe cheers my heart my wants supplies\r\nAnd says that I shall shortly be\r\nEnthroned with Him above the skies\r\nOh! what a Friend is Christ to me!\r\n\r\nOh where are those mansions of light\r\nThat home, ever happy and fair\r\nThat land where the days are all bright\r\nUnsullied by sorrow and care\r\n\r\nFar far from this valley of tears\r\nThe Saviour has gone to prepare\r\nThose mansions, and when he appears\r\nHis people shall dwell with Him there\r\n\r\nOh happy and glorious 'twill be\r\nTo meet in those mansions above\r\nFrom sin and from sorrow set free\r\nAll perfect for ever in love!",
