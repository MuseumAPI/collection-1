Two lower ends of pillars, each with a mask; a mask; a volute probably for a keystone. Two parts of grotesque decoration with half-figure of a man with two scrolls; a witch with burning torch, which a running woman reaches for. The latter has her right foot upon a support in shape of an enlarged winged ring, which is held by a female half-figure. This is connected by a lying animal with the long branch on whose top is the witch and a snake, at whose head is the left hand of the running woman. The branch ends below in a fantastic fish. Written below: \u201cDel Cav re Filippo Marchionni.\u201d The man is below at left. He is seen from the right back and has a stick in his left hand pointing with his raised right arm.",
