    "biography": "French ceramicist Cl\u00e9ment Massier, considered as one of the main creators of iridescence in ceramics, was born into a ceramics-producing family and took an early interest in the business. As early  as age 12 he was focussed on the work of Gandolfo Gaetano, an employee of his family's, who introduced enamelling techniques to the Massier firm.  After an extended period of study, work and travel,  he re-located his part of the family firm to Golfe-Juan, Alpes Maritime, France, in 1884. There he began producing iridescent glazes from silver and copper oxide, influenced by Hispano-Moresque-influenced pottery in a smoky kiln, especially after  the arrival Lucien L\u00e9vy-Dhurmer in 1887.  L\u00e9vy-Dhumer both collected Hispano-Moresque ceramics and expanded Massier\u2019s breadth of glazes and techniques. With L\u00e9vy-Dhumer\u2019s collaboration Massier introduced fiery luster glazes enriched with etching and painting, on a variety of forms ranging from strongly individualistic handwork to more uniform slip-cast work.   Massier continued to explore and expand their work in luster glazes long after L\u00e9vy-Dhumer's departure from the firm in 1896 for an elite international clientele.  In 1897 Massier's factory employed 65 workers. \nHis work was rewarded by a gold medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1889. In 1898 he presented fifteen pieces with metallic lustre at the Salon of the Society of French Artists.",
