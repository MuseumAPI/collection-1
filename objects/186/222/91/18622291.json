And better.; column of black printed text, lower margin, left of center: Action Office\u00ae is a case in point. In 1964 we introduced \/ that landmark system as a management planning \/ tool adaptable to the work requirements of various \/ kinds of people, various kinds of tasks, various kinds \/ of organizations. In 1968 we brought out a vastly improved system, far ahead of anything the industry \/ had ever seen or even thought of.; column of black printed text, lower margin, center: But we didn\u2019t stop there. Or then. Designed from the \/ start as an open-ended system, Action Office has \/ undergone a steady series of refinements, additions \/ and modifications to meet new needs. Some of these \/ product improvements, such as Super Room\u2122 and Low \/ Profile\u2122, are themselves major innovations. Others, \/ such as the swingaway telephone stand, are modest \/ but welcome details. And the same system is \/ adaptable to libraries, word processing units, and \/ technical work stations of all kinds.; column of black printed text, lower margin, right of center: By now the original Action Office has been enriched \/ by lateral files, a sub-system of EDP components, \/ counter caps, sound-absorbing panels, curved \/ panels with work surfaces to fit them, door panels, \/ acoustic conditioners, flipper doors that glide on \/ a synchronizing mechanism, transaction counters, \/ versatile connection hardware, deep drawers, Rapid \/ Response\u2122 service, new finishes, wire managers. . . .; column of black printed text, lower margin, far right: The list could go on and on. And it will. Things from \/ Herman Miller are getting better all the time.; in black, lower center: herman miller; in black, bottom center: \u00a9Copyright 1976. Herman Miller, Inc.
