    "description":"The plaster frieze running around the upper walls depicts Thorvaldsen's relief of Alexander the Great's Triumphal Entry into Babylon, commissioned by Napoleon in 1812 for the throne room of the Quirinal Palace in Rome. The coffered ceiling is decorated with carved roundels interspersed with octagonal paintings; in addition, a large painting occupies the center. The walls are hung with crimson brocade and the windows with dark green silk.  A red and gold tester, hung with a red velvet curtain, serves as backdrop to a red-skirted table trimmed with gold braid; a black cross sits on the table. A tall painting of a seated religious figure is placed above a marble chimneypiece. The marble floor is designed in a geometric pattern.",
