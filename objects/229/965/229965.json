  "description": "A truly eclectic style of decoration prevails in this New York City library. The placement of the settee, recessed into a bookcase, is typical of the Aesthetic Movement. The green and yellow printed upholstery fabric reflects the designs of William Morris, as do the window drapery and valance. The chandelier has elements of the Gothic Revival style; however, the desk lamp looks toward Art Nouveau. Hydrangeas at the window; a floral arrangement on the sofa table; and porcelains, glass and sculptures are common features of the Victorian period.",
