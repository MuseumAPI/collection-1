A bowl of flowers is placed above a medallion enclosing a suckling sheep with lamb, surrounded by a wreath; and below a brule-parfum flanked by two birds taking strawberries from compotes. Above the latter motif is the fourth motif of the design, confronted putti dancing on a baldaquin from which hang two swags.",
