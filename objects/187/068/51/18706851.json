    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Developed for Paillard S. A., and engineered by Giuseppe Preziosos, this small, light, typewriter, was identified with Hermes, the Greek&amp;nbsp;god of travel and commerce. The model was part of the company's portable line of Hermes typewriters (including the Hermes 'Baby,' 'Featherweight,' and 'Rocket') the first truly small portable machines on the market. The 'Rocket' is an excellent example of precision engineering in a streamlined, functionalist form that predicted the shape of later modern typewriters, as seen in its low, clearn angular profile, and metal housing in cool colors-gray with red stripe where body meets spool covers, and simple bold white and red lettering proclaiming Hermes 'Rocket.'\nRevolutionary for its small, light form, it was conceived as a practical compact machine for travel, small enough to fit into a briefcase. The overall size and weight were reduced by economical construction: the case itself strengthened the frame and the internal parts were regularized. Size could also be kept to a minimum by means of the machine's innovative method of printing capital letters by raising the carriage and roller instead of the typebars, so they did not require extra space in the housing. Despite this change in mechanism, the keyboard and operation were the same as those of a standard machine. Inexpensive and reliable, the 'Rocket' was a favorite of journalists and writers such as Hemingway and Steinbeck, for it sportability and reliability.&quot;",
