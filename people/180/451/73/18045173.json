    "biography": "Jules Bouy was born in France in 1872. Before World War I he was known as a European distributor of historicist-revival furnishings. After the war, he began working as a designer for two different firms that were based in New York: L. Alavoine and Company and Ferrobrandt. His work for L. Alavoine maintained a traditional aesthetic, however, his work with designer Edgar Brandt at Ferrobrandt and the work he did once he opened his own firm called Bouy, Inc., provided him with an opportunity to explore the new forms of modern design that were emerging in the United States in the 1920s. By the end of the 1920s, his work developed from the French Art Deco styles of the 1925 Paris Exposition to the more simplified American modernist forms seen in the work of others like Paul T. Frankl and Winold Reiss. He developed a distinct vocabulary of curves and scalloped edges. His work was exhibited around New York and reproduced in various publications including  House and Garden, Arts and Decoration, The Studio International, and the New York Times.",
