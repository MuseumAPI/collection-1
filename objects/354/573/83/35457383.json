    "description": "The Mau relate to the Dan and Wee peoples of the forest to their south and to the Bamana of the savanna to the northeast. Like the Dan and Wee, the Mau make miniature versions of their large masks to function as personal protective charms. Like the Komo society masks of the Bamana, Mau masks are heavily encrusted with sacrificial materials. Offerings still remain on the interior of this mask but have been removed from the front.",
