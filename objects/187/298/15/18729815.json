    "justification": "From Acquistion justification:\nContext:Marcel Wanders is a young veteran of contemporary Dutch design.&amp;nbsp; He is a member of the Dutch cooperative Droog (Dry) Design, sharing their vision for simplicity and occasional wit, creating visually spare and modest designs.&amp;nbsp; His early works are distinguished by their use of ordinary materials or things---string, sponges, eggs, lamp shades---employed in new and often surprisingly delightful ways.&amp;nbsp; Because of this, many of Wanders designs have the look of familiarity, like his &quot;Knotted Chair&quot; that evokes a time-worn hammock, but with a contemporary sensibility.\nThe object:The chair is of rope &quot;made from braided aramid fibers wrapped around a carbon core, knotted into the shape of a chair. It is then impregnated with epoxy and hung on a frame to harden.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Like many Droog designs, &quot;Knotted Chair&quot; is a craft-based approach to new materials, synthesizing ancient techniques, in this case, macram\u00e9, with high-tech fibers to yield a new furniture form.\nAlthough originally part of the Droog collection, &quot;Knotted Chair&quot; is now distributed by the Italian manufacturer Cappellini.&amp;nbsp; It was an outgrowth of a collaboration between the Droog Design Foundation and the Laboratory for Structures and Materials at the Faculty of Aviation and Aerospace of the University of Technology in Delft.&amp;nbsp; The result was a new durable chair design that achieves lightness and delicacy, both physically and visually.",
