  "description": "This stately drawing room features a fashionable sky-patterned ceiling with a trompe l'oeil of an eagle holding the central chandelier; matching dark green wall covering and curtains; and wood carvings by Grinling Gibbons. Paintings flanking the door are by J. M. W. Turner; the one to the right is titled The Thames at Walton Bridge. On either side of the fireplace, pediments holding bronze statuettes are attributed to Andre Boulle himself, while mounted porcelain vases decorate the tops of Boulle-style cabinets. A table and chais are in the Louis XV style. On the left, there is a woman seated at a piano and on the right, a small dog in the foreground.",
