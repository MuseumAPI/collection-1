  "description": "Design for an ornamental panel, with vertical orientation.  Above the vase with a sphinx and two griffins, which is located at the bottom of the composition, is a nest of acanthus leaves; springing from it are two rinceaux/scrolls, nearly symmetrically winding up.  The rosettes, terminating the scrolls, have all been replaced by the artist, by pieces of paper pasted over.  Three putti and three birds are placed along the scrolls.  The acanthus scrolls are framed on all sides, except the top edge, by a decorative molding.  Signed at lower left corner.",
