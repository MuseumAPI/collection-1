The supports consist of fluted consoles upon which two children are seated beside a flower pot in front of a shell at right. Half of a similar motif is upon the support at left. A landscape with a Doric temple in ruins and pyramids are shown. The upper part suggests an ovoidal painting in rich framing. At right is an imaginary arch double the width of that at left.",
