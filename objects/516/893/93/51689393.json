    "justification": "\nThe familiar compact form of the Swiss Army knife, as its name suggests, began as a practical tool for soldiers. The Swiss Army knife as we know it was developed by Swiss cutler Karl Elsener in 1891, when he won the contract to produce the knife from the previous German manufacturer. &amp;nbsp;Elsener\u2019s 1891 knife contained a steel blade, reamer, can opener, and screw driver in a metal and wood housing. Dissatisfied with the weight and limited functions of this first version,&amp;nbsp; by 1896 Elsener made improvements and succeeded in attaching tools on both sides of the handle using an innovative spring mechanism that also held the tools in place. The knife had twice as many features than its predecessor, and could be considered the template for&amp;nbsp;today's range.&amp;nbsp; Elsener\u2019s redesigned knife was well received by the Army and also&amp;nbsp;found&amp;nbsp;favor in the public marketplace:&amp;nbsp; this new version of the pocket-sized tool was slightly more compact, easy to hold, had a more elegant outline, and used only two springs for six tools. &amp;nbsp;By 1897 the knife was sporting the now familiar red housing, and by 1908, the&amp;nbsp;emblem of the shield and cross was embossed on&amp;nbsp;its side. Stories of use by the military, explorers, and even astronauts,&amp;nbsp;have made&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Swiss Army knife&amp;nbsp;synonymous with dependability and quality in function and design. Both the form and&amp;nbsp;emblem&amp;nbsp;inspire contemporary consumers\u2019 confidence&amp;nbsp;whether the&amp;nbsp;knife is intended as&amp;nbsp;a convenient multi-tool for daily activities or a compact emergency&amp;nbsp;tool kit for any contingency.\nThe Swiss Champ SOS is a survival kit in the form of a pocket knife. The knife itself comes with 33 \u201cstandard\u201d implements\u2014various blades and tools that&amp;nbsp;pivot out of the tough and&amp;nbsp;resilient stainless steel body,&amp;nbsp;and several&amp;nbsp;that can be removed from slim cavities in the durable red plastic . The tools&amp;nbsp;include a can opener, pliers, magnifying glass, toothpick, tweezers and pen.&amp;nbsp;The black leather case houses not only the knife, but an additional 14 items such as sharpening stone, matches, signal mirror, sewing kit, ruler, spirit&amp;nbsp;level,&amp;nbsp;and compass. Together, the&amp;nbsp;knife and case&amp;nbsp;contain a total of 101 survival features in a compact form that is easy to carry and hold, and has good balance in the hand when in use.\n&amp;nbsp;",
