Diagonally placed in reverse positions, the two letters intersect to form an abstract figure. The \"x\" formed by the two letters is scalloped. The company name, Lightolier, is imprinted across the center in black serif-style type, and is divided by the logo placed between the \"T\" and the \"O.\"",
