    "description":"Long narrow panel in three sections. In the largest section, the field is patterned by a small scale plaid in red, black, and yellow with the addition of a small scale pattern or narrow bands. At one end there is a deep border patterned by narrow isolated gold bands on a red and black striped ground. At the opposite end, there is a more elaborately patterned border in gold on a red and black striped ground featuring the \"tumpal\" motif (row of isosceles triangles). A narrow geometric band in gold is continuous along what would be the bottom of the sarong when worn.",
