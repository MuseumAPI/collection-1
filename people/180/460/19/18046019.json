    "biography": "Frances Butler began as a printer of fabrics, printing calligraphy on fabric in 1965. In the beginning, she was interested in blending several art media, such as stretching a sewn fabric over metal structure and then painting it. Butler designed in several different media: posters, silkscreening and applique dressmaking. She was extremely experimental. When Butler tired of applique dressmaking, she began printing and airbrushing fabric for her dresses. Eventually she turned to the market and created functional products with her printed fabrics, such as comforters and tablecloths with printed words and images, and printed collapsible tea tables. In 1973, she launched a fabric printing company called Goodstuffs, which produced fabric graphics, wall hangings, and other products which were sold to J.C. Penney\u2019s and Macy\u2019s. Butler launched a publishing press called Poltroon Press for which she produced book illustrations and wall designs. With both companies, located in Emeryville, CA, she was able to produce different merchandise for interiors and households.",
