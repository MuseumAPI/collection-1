    "biography": "Svenja John was born in Germany in 1963. She studied archeology at Ruhr University, Bochum between 1985 and 1989, and goldsmithing in Hanau from 1991-93. She started her own jewelry studio in Berlin in 1994. She is known for her jewelry constructions made of macrofol, a polycarbonate processed to create foil, from which she makes modules which she joins, and stacks or nests. Through this process she creates semi-opaque clusters and structures reminiscent of scientific models, or crystalline and organic structures. Her pieces are hand-coloured and fitted with clips and clasps for attachment. She conceives of each form, imagining \"pictures I simply copy\" as she puts it, before beginning the making process. Her work has been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide.",
