    "justification": "\nClaudy Jongstra is a contemporary textile designer who practices the ancient technique of felting.&amp;nbsp; Since the mid-1990s she has created extraordinary felted fabrics for fashion designers such as John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, and Donna Karan, and architects and designers Steven Holl, Will Bruder, Jasper Morrison, and Marcel Wanders. Jongstra\u2019s fabrics have a raw elegance that comes from her use of materials such as wild silk, wild linen, and wild cashmere, as well as the special (and proprietary) techniques she has developed in her felting.&amp;nbsp; Jongstra even goes so far as to raise her own sheep in the Dutch countryside and currently has a herd of 200 including the rare species of long-haired Drenthe Heath, whose shorn locks she felts along with the straw and lanolin that accumulates on their hair.\nThis textile by Jongstra is a primary example of felting, which is a technique that uses the application of pressure, heat, and moisture to mat together fibers. Oftentimes the fibers are not spun or twisted, but are simply a mass of fibers lying indiscriminately in all directions. Two fabrics in particular by Jongstra, Composition (DH\/WD\/SI 001), seen here, and Composition (SI 001) (2005-3-2), were commissioned specifically for the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt. They exemplify not only the general range of felting techniques, but also the variety of Jongstra\u2019s work.&amp;nbsp;This textile&amp;nbsp;is made of wool merino, Drenthe Heath, Wensley Dale, wild silk, and cotton gauze appears to come directly from the back of the sheep.
