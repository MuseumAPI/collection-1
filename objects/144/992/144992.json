  "description": "Futuristic rendering of a dark, monumental complex of high-rise structures on a plinth-like base.  The central building extends vertically and is cut off by edge of sheet.  Flanking the central structure, two symmetrical towers whose sloping sides end in steep and sharp points.  Tall and narrow vertical buttresses along the facades repeat the upward thrust of the structures.  Another skyscraper building is seen in the left distance.  Rays of light emanating from the right distance and backlighting left side of the building complex emphasize the visual drama.",
