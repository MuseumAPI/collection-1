    "description": "Narrow rectangular fabric, hemmed at both ends with red stitching, is striped in white and two shades of indigo.",
    "justification": "This <a>African<\/a>&amp;nbsp;cloth, called akwa-mmiri, literally \u201ccloth of water\u201d, is made from locally grown, hand-spun cotton yarns, hand-dyed in two shades of indigo blue. These blues plus white are used to form irregular stripes down the center of the narrow panel. Historically associated with the war dance, today the cloth may be worn for this dance, for a special festival such as Eloso, the New Year festival celebrated once every two years in September, or the New Yam Festival, or for the funeral of an important man. In the funeral context, it is a mark of respect for the deceased, indicating that he was a courageous man and a defender of his community. Akwa-mmiri is handed down from the father to the eldest son in a family, often at the time of the death of the father. For the dance, the cloth can be worn as a loincloth, but for ceremonial use today is often worn tied in a single knot at the waist, over a floor-length piece of George, a fine cotton plaid fabric imported from India which is also highly valued in this society. This type of fabric is still very important and has a high societal value. ",
