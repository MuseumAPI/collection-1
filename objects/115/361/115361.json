  "description": "Recto: Of the five female heads in various attitudes, the most fully realized, on the left in the lower half of the page, is a left profile view. The hair, covered by a snood-like headdress, frames the face in a wave extending from the top of the head to the ear level, marked by a button earring. A curved line from the neck to the left indicates the shoulder and a scalloped edge forms the neckline. \r\n\r\nFour additional less-finished views, along with lettering, varied in both content and style, are scattered over the page. \r\n\r\nVerso: On the upper right, unusual, in capitals, and on the lower left, a foliate design, appear on the page.",
