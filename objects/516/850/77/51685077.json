    "justification": "Characteristic of&amp;nbsp;good&amp;nbsp;French Art Nouveau&amp;nbsp;design, this inkwell is an example of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;stylistic unity&amp;nbsp;created by&amp;nbsp;co-ordinating&amp;nbsp;artistic style in different materials used together,&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;instances of media&amp;nbsp;by different designers.&amp;nbsp;Dalpayrat's ceramics were often as fluid as the metalwork mounts that adorn this inkwell. In this case, he chose a fairly traditional form in order to feature his other interest---free-flowing and innovative glazes that flow around on the stoneware as if&amp;nbsp;they were enamel&amp;nbsp;on metal. Visible in the glazes is the red that came to be known as Dalpayrat red,&amp;nbsp;due to his mastery of the color.&amp;nbsp;Some of Dalpayrat's work for Samuel Bing was embellished with&amp;nbsp;bronze mounts executed by Edouard Colonna. &amp;nbsp;It is possible that the mounts on this inkwell were also by Colonna.",
