  "description": "Central image is what appears to be a dance between two metalic pin shaped cartoon creatures, green on the left and orange on the right. They dance on stylized flowers and vines against a striated air-brushed background of pink and blue bands. A lage yellow cell with nerve-endings floats above.  At top a band of black with asteroids suggests the universe.",
