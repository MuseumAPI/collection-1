  "description": "The drawing is depicted in outline. A female in a slouching position is seated on a sofa. She leans against a pillow in back, her head rising above both the pillow and sofa frame. Her shoulders are hunched. Her bent arm rests on the frame, which appears to be of wood or metal, of the sofa arm on the left, and the other arm bends across the body just above the waist, where the two hands clasp. Her shoulders are raised slightly and her legs are crossed. The drawing is cut off below the knee close to the bottom edge of the page. The subject wears a close-fitting hat; a jacket or dress with revers; dangling earrings; a one-strand beaded necklace; and several bangles (or a cuff bracelet) on the right. Although her eyes are open, she seems lost in thought (or bored).",
