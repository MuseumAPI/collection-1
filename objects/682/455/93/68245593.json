    "description": "the shield-shaped silver pendant with three cut-out openings at top above a  guilloch\u00e9 blue enamel oval with punched circles below, a baroque pearl drop suspended at the bottom",
    "justification": "Pendants formed a smaller but popular form of Horner jewelry.&amp;nbsp; Celtic crosses had inspired arts and crafts movement jewelry. In Horner\u2019s creations, they evolved into a more art nouveau style. This pendant has a smooth, sharper-edged cut-out silver profile from a sheet of silver, which was punched with the protruding circular design at the base.&amp;nbsp; It is done in guilloch\u00e9 enamel, meaning that instead of engraving or chasing a pattern below the enamel, engine-turning creates the pattern, below, in this case, a single color of aqua blue translucent enamel, adding the appearance of texture and pattern to the smooth surface.&amp;nbsp; This pendant has a smooth surface, and with its guilloch\u00e9 enamel simple oval center, moves away from Art Nouveau.\nNo design authorship is claimed anywhere on drawings or in catalogues for any of the designs the firm produced. However, the most art nouveau pieces were produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most art nouveau style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. \nWhile most of the jewelry was mass-produced, using silver wire, ribbon or formed into swirls, circles and other shapes, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand. For both pendants and brooches in this collection, they would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.\n&amp;nbsp;",
