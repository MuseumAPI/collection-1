    "description": "Abstract butterfly form comprising simple, curved body studded with small diamonds, flanked by wings with polychrome lacquer, mother-of-pearl, egg shell, and gold decoration inspired by \u2018Kodai-ji makie\u2019 using Chinese bell flower motif.",
    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The butterfly has been a recurring motif for Van Cleef &amp; Arpels with designs ranging from realistic renderings to the fanciful creatures in turquoise and rubies from the 1940s. Current production includes a combination of the jewelry art of working in gold and diamonds mixed with Japanese lacquering techniques. The butterfly form is created in gold with a mother-of-pearl base in the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels workshops.&amp;nbsp; The pieces are then sent to Japan where the lacquering is created to previously approved designs based on Japanese symbolism. These master craftsmen have been trained in centuries-old techniques which can be found elsewhere in the collection, (such as inro, flattened cylindrical boxes with compartments that often held medicine). Traditional design sources are rendered with a modern eye and enhanced with the use of materials such as eggshell worked into the lacquer for innovative finishes. These pieces represent a combination of the craftsmanship associated with the decorative arts as well as with high jewelry and the use of the latter\u2019s precious materials.&quot;",
