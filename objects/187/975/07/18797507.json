    "description": "Drawing of ebony and dark snake wood bangle with gray navette diamond and brown navette diamond crafted out of plantimun and white gold.  Represents an early example of an innovative pivoting mechanism.  This bracelet was produced in 1996 on commission with one minor modification.  Instead of snake wood Padoukholz was used.",
    "justification": "\nIn 1995, Stefan Hemmerle experienced the remarkable creative breakthrough that prompted him to begin pairing precious and semi-precious stones with surprising and provocative materials.&amp;nbsp; This drawing, sketched in part by Stefan and completed by a member of his staff, illustrates one of the earliest examples of this irreverent but strikingly seductive combination.&amp;nbsp; The bracelet\u2019s form is comprised of two contrasting woods, ebony and snake wood.&amp;nbsp; Set on either end are brilliant diamonds of different colors.&amp;nbsp; This Harmony Bangle was among the first to feature Hemmerle\u2019s innovative pivoting mechanism, further enhancing the seamless closure.&amp;nbsp; Executed in ink wash, gouache, and watercolor, the drawing conveys the subtle differences in tone and texture that have become the distinctive signature of the Hemmerle firm.&amp;nbsp; ",
