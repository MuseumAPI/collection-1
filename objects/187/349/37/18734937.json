Searles, an interior decorator and architectural designer, was former West Coast sales representative for Herter Bros and inherited the bulk of Mary's estate upon her death in 1891. The  three chairs were part of his Pine Lodge estate in Methuen Massachusetts; then by descent from the heir to the Pine Lodge estate to the last owner who sold them in East Moriches, NY in April 2008.  All three, one of which has a pencil inscription \"Hopkins\" underneath the upholstery, were acquired and re-upholstered in antique period silk by Margot Johnson who offered this chair for sale. The Museum has been provided with a photograph of the inscription.",
