    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;This dish is of similar date and process to the pitcher and represents the cranberry color for which Sandwich was appropriately famous, with its proximity to the cranberry bogs of Cape Cod.&amp;nbsp; This wildly popular color was imitated, usually with less skill for color, hardness and clarity, by contemporary and later firms, but this plate shows strength and clarity of the glass.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The only known catalogue of Sandwich glass that incorporates the &quot;overshot&quot; or &quot;ice glass&quot; appears to have a plate of this shape but it is viewed from the side so it is hard to say if it is the same depth.&amp;nbsp; For further evidence,&amp;nbsp; excavations at the original factory in the 1930's turned up hundreds of thousands of shards that have added circumstantial evidence of certain styles and patterns being made there, including of the cranberry overshot type.&quot;",
