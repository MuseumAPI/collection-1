During opening ceremonies, a representative from each nation placed its copper element on slender rods radiating from the heart of the stadium, a central location that engaged the crowd and helped shape the ritual pageantry. Lit by young athletes, the individual flames were lifted and surged into a single, symbolic blaze. Afterward, the unique elements, patinated by the heat, became individual mementos for the 204 participating countries",
