  "description": "Dramatic view of interior of Saint Peter's in Rome on Holy Thursday.  View is from the right transept looking into the nave in which a large cross is suspended from the dome, composed of several hundred candles.  Beneath the cross in the nave stand numerous figures; others stand and kneel in the transept.  The illumination from the cross casts areas of light as well as dark shadows on the vaulted ceilings and walls.",
