    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The luster ware ceramics produced by the Zsolnay Art Pottery of Pecs, Hungary represent some of the most innovate forms and glazing technology of the late 19th and early 20th century. The Zsolnay firm was founded in 1853 by Miklos Zsolnay, and his son Vilmos Zsolnay took over the company's leadership in 1865. It was under Vilmos that Zsolnay began to innovate both the design and technology of its ceramic wares. Cobining local tradition with close attention to the stylistic developments in England and France, Zsolnay's production was unique in the period. \nVilmos' experimentation included reintepretation of historical forms, including those with references to the Far Eastern origins of luster ware...It was Zsolnay's use of eosin-reduced glazing to create free-form (non figural) color patterns on equally sinuous ceramic bodies that made the company's production so popular at the turn of the twentieth-century...&quot;",
