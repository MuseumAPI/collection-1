    "description":"This view features a woman's bedroom, identified as such by the bonnet next to the ribbon-framed mirror and the blue slippers at the foot of the bed. Scandinavian design is shown in the bed at the right, draped in white cotton; curtains-to-match hang at the large French windows in the rear of the room. The ash-colored wooden furniture along with the wide wood planked floor and buff-colored walls indicate that this may be a summer retreat or hotel. Views of the countryside are seen through the windows.",
