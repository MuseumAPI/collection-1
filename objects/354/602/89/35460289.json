    "justification":"David Linley, the professional name of David Armstrong-Jones, Lord Linley, is one of Britain's best known furniture maker-designers. Hespecializes in high quality and sophisticated combinations of materials in furniture and other designs that reference history but are firmly contemporary.&amp;nbsp; A skilled practitioner of inlay and of architectural design applied to decorative arts objects, he caters to collectors of many periods.&amp;nbsp; While his start in 1985&amp;nbsp;may have been smoothed by being the son of Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, he was very quick to make his mark through top level designs and execution, leading to a significant influence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This model shows both architectural liveliness combined with very refined turning and carving of the elements used.&amp;nbsp; Linley is a designer who belongs in the top rank of contemporary furniture collections.",
