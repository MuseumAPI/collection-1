    "justification": "\nOne of Alphonse Maria Mucha\u2019s &amp;nbsp;many commercial clients at the turn of the century was the French winery Mo\u00ebt Chandon. &amp;nbsp;Mucha created a variety of promotional material for Mo\u00ebt Chandon, including posters, catalogues, and menu cards such as that proposed for acquisition. This lithographed card features a full-length illustration of a young woman in fashionable dress holding a glass of champagne, Mo\u00ebt Chandon\u2019s iconic product. &amp;nbsp;Mucha\u2019s frequent motif, the halo-like circle behind the woman\u2019s head, features the company\u2019s name. &amp;nbsp;In his work for Mo\u00ebt Chandon, Mucha sought to choose women who evoked the particular qualities of the wine that was being advertised. In the case of this card, Mucha designed a woman with light-colored hair and a pale dress against a darker, patterned background, conjuring the light and bubbly qualities of the firm\u2019s champagne. The card has been inscribed on the front and back with a menu for an unknown event.",
