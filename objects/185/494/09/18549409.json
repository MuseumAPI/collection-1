    "description": "Vertical rectangle. The receptacle of the reliquary is shaped like a column, which is carried by a cherub who stands upon a base, which is supported by knobs. The top of the shaft of the column is surrounded by a crown of thorns, beneath which four cherubim are shown. At left and at right of the shaft are cherubim and leaf scrolls, the lower of which are connected with the cherub below by festoons. On top of the columns are a kind of onion dome and a cross. A cherub is very slightly sketched as a support of the reliquary.",
