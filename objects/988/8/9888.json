  "description": "A view into a hall resembling the Pantheon in Rome (coffered dome with oculus resting on a curving colonnade).  Hermae are shown standing between the columns.  At the left hand side, is a monument comprised of a male bust set on a round pedestal, elevated from the ground by high base. The stream of light, coming from the oculus, shines directly upon the bust.  At the foot of the pedestal and in front of the base stands an incense burner, smoke rises above.  A small figure is tending to the fire.   At the center of the composition are three female figures, one seated and two standing.  The seated figure leans on a lyre, while the standing figures hold masks.  At the right hand side, mythological creatures chase each other.  Above the entire composition, positioned against the coffered ceiling, flies a winged figure with a trumpet and wreath.",
