  "description": "The reverse bell-shaped shade appears to be fabricated of opaque white glass, and is decorated by a geometric frieze at the top. The shade sits on a shaft, probably metallic, which tapers from top to bottom, where it again widens into the horizontal base. Shading is prominent on the sides of the lampshade and throughout the shaft.",
