    "description": "The buildings of the monastery are in the middle ground upon a terrace of a hill sloping down to the foreground. There is a wall with the gateway, where a guard and a group of monks stand. Monks and soldiers are on the road connecting the gateways, outer and inner, in front of the church. Once of the soldiers busies himself to chase to fighting dogs. A coach drawn by four horses, preceded by a courier, approaches from right. A family sits inside. Another coach with two horses follows. At left are groups of people. Trees flank the scene.",
