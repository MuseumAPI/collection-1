In 2006, she returned to Konstfack to receive her MFA (2008) in  \u00c4dellab- silversmithing and jewelry under the guidance of Ruudt Peters and Karen Pontoppidan. \n\nHer ornamental jewelry combines abstraction with figural forms and addresses the intersection between reality and fantasy. In 2008, upon completion of her MFA, her series \u201cEnough Tears to Cry for Two,\u201d was exhibited in New York City. She has participated in both solo and group exhibitions internationally, and has won many awards for her intricate and fantastical designs.
