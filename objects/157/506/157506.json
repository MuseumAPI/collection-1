  "description": "Horizontal rectangular hanging with a landscape dominated by a pyramid-shaped yellow temple with a long flight of white steps leading to an orange door. The temple is surrounded by trees with white trunks and green foliage, with exotic fruits hanging down. Three female figures approach from the right with baskets of fruit on their heards.  A dark grey sky has stars, planets, sun and moon in white. Jaguars prowl the foreground among crawling vines.",
