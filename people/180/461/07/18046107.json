    "biography": "Sumiko Honda is the in-house fabric designer of Kawashima Selkon Textiles Co., a Japanese fabric producer founded in 1843.  She began working for the company in 1986 and released her first in-house Sumiko Honda collection in 1998. Honda\u2019s collections of woven fabrics for interiors are designed to bring a sense of peace into urban dwelling. Many of her fabric designs pay respect to historic Japanese patterns and traditions, such as paying homage to the transitions between nature\u2019s seasons or exploring the subtle qualities of light and shadow. Honda presents her designs as both something that improves one\u2019s quality of living and as works of art in their own right. Her fabrics combine contemporary designs and cutting edge technology with traditional concepts and weaving technology.  She has collaborated with other major designers and artists, both in Japan and internationally. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, Honda won the Japan Craft Exhibition prize.",
