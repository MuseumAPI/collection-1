  "description": "The male (?) subject, perhaps in military dress, wears a close-fitting, ancient Roman style headdress, which segues into stylized ringlets framing the lower part of the face. The upper body garment is trimmed by an ornament (perhaps depicting rank) on the left shoulder and a neckband in a unbroken curve design. The features - straight nose, fleshy mouth, closed eye, and rounded chin - have a sculpural appearance.",
