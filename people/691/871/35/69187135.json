She trained as an artist as a young girl and worked in the textile industry starting in 1957, and by 1965 she was working with her chemist husband, Ferdinand Steinberger, to develop a process of layering thin sheets of plastic to make the multi-colored and textured plastics for which she is known. Her jewelry is made in two periods, as she stopped producing for a time: 1969 \u2013 1981 and 1991 to the present.",
