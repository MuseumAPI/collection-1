    "description": "This is a typical salon of mid-nineteenth century France, possibly in Paris. The walls are hung with dark green striped paper and the floor covered with a carpet of Rococo Revival floral design.  Red draperies are hung from gilt-bronze poles. The cabinet-on-stand, chairs, and candelabra are decorated with gilt-bronze elements in the Empire style.  Large porcelain vases, probably Chinese, flank the candelabra. A large crystal chandelier hangs over a cloth-covered table.  A kneehole desk with a green leather [?] top is most probably English.  Ancestor portraits and an antique statue placed on a pedestal table complete the salon of a royal or aristocratic owner.",
