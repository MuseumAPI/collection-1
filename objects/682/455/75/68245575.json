    "justification": "&amp;nbsp;This example shows a wonderful blue-green richly varied enamel with almost Celtic scrolls. \nNo design authorship is claimed anywhere on drawings or in catalogues for any of the designs the firm produced. However, the most art nouveau pieces were produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most art nouveau style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. \nWhile mass-produced, using silver wire, ribbon or formed into swirls, circles and other shapes, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand and was in the basse-taille \u2013or shallow-cut- technique.&amp;nbsp; This technique involves cutting through engraving or chasing silver with bas-relief patterns and covering that in translucent enamel. Rich tonal qualities are achieved by varying the amounts of engraving and depth of enamel. \nBrooches&amp;nbsp;would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.\n&amp;nbsp;",
