  "description": "1993-151-187a, Letterhead - The design is comprised of a diagonal view of a three dimensional sign on posts in outline form, displaying Acme in capital letters, and centered at the top of the page. Acme Entertainment Inc, imprinted in smaller sans serif style capitals, is centered just underneath. The address and telephone numbers are imprinted in smaller type in a comparable position, just above the bottom edge. Immediately to the left, focused on these four lines, is an outline of a crook-necked table lamp, with short diagonal lines extending from the shade, signifying lamplight.\r\n\r\n1993-151-187b, Envelope - The business name, in identically styled but larger type than on the letterhead, is imprinted in the top left hand corner; the address follows in smaller type just underneath. In the lower left hand corner, a suburban/ rural style mailbox in outline form, with its flag up and its post abbreviated, is labeled Acme , repeating the type format used on the letterhead.",
