In the middle of the composition, the words \"OF\/FASHION\" span the two columns. The white ground is printed with a grid of small dots. The poster was designed to advertise an exhibition at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa.",
    "justification": "Experimental Jetset designed the graphic identity for the traveling exhibition \u201cOut of Fashion\u201d that originated at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam and was shown at NAiM \/ Bureau Europa, an architecture institute in Maastricht, Netherlands.&amp;nbsp; The exhibition focused on the relationship between fashion and cinema.&amp;nbsp; For their poster design, the team chose a graphic word play on the phrase Out of Fashion by adding additional or alternate prepositions, including Up, In, On and Of.&amp;nbsp; The designers drew inspiration from the title of the film by William Klein \u201cIn and Out of Fashion.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Tying the composition together, Experimental Jetset generated a layer of dots that recalls both textile patterns and the grainy resolution of film and video screens.",
