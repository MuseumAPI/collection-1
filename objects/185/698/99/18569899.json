    "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating six sketches of buildings or architectural ornaments from Chenonceaux and Beaulieu.  The upper half of the sheet contains four drawings.  From left is a Renaissance style cupola consisting of three arcaded loggias culminating in a cross finial.  The lowest loggia has the tallest arches, between which can be seen a bell. To the right of this is a small sketch of a window and dormer, the dormer having a very high projecting pediment and small flame-like finials on top of it and to the left and right.  To the right of this is a very elaborate dormer, its upper windowed section supported at left and right by two cusped, round-arched buttresses.  Above this is a very small drawing of a cupola and its finial.  The bottom half of the sheet illustrates two complete buildings as opposed to their elements.  At bottom left is a large tower consisting of a group of turrets massed together.  At right is a house seen from the corner, a single turret visible at the left corner, and the peaked roof another seen at right.  A small plan of this structure is drawn below the elevation.",
