    "description": "Horizontal rectangle. Design for sofa at left, chair in center, both shown obliquely from the front corners. The sofa is supported at the front by four lion feet. The lower ends of the arms of the sofa stand upon the heads of crouching winged lions with scrolls as foils. The seat and the back are upholstered, the latter in three sections which are framed by poles with lion heads carrying wings, on top. The chair is of a similar design, but the legs and the arms are without animal forms. At right is, vertically, the right half of a console table. The top is shaped like an entablature. It is supported at the corner by a lion chimaera, in the center by a pilaster. Something is shown standing upon the table. Vertically at upper right is the left half of a console table with looking glass. The console consists of a back side and the supports formed by pairs of winged lion chimaerae standing with the backs to one another. The upper part forms an entablature. The height is indicated as in 1938-88-546: \"p. rom 422\". The frame of the mirror is supported by pairs of claws. It has laterally columns with a row of female heads below the capitals. Knobs are laterally on top. Above the inner frame is a decorated frieze.",
