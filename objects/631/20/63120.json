Above the aedicula are two crossed halbards wtih a trophy of arms and festoons. Above them are scrolls with half-figures and an eagle. The candelabra end with half-figures of winged women who support with the head and the raised hands a picture of soliders in a landscpe. Upon the upper rim of the frame stand two running women, who support a candelabrum. At the corners sit sphixes with flower baskets upon their heads. From lateral scrolls of the candelabrum spring half-figures carrying branches of wreaths. On top are two dragons.",
