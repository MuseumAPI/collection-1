Many\r\ndaughters have done virtuously but may we remembering our peculiar obligations excel them all.  \r\nBlest be the grace which moved the feeling heart \r\nTo plead the cause of man and break his chains\r\nBlest be the men who taught the heavenly art\r\nTo banish slav'ry's bonds from freedoms plains\r\nLet Afric's (sic) daughters feel the grateful ties\r\nWhich bind then to reward their Patrons care \r\nBy striving to obtain the noble prize \r\nOf praise on earth and heav'n's bright crown to wear\r\n\r\n",
