  "description": "The robe is shaped in the manner of a Japanese kimono. It is made of a small scale woven checked cloth of brown, black and white. The design was made by cutting curved elements out of white fabric and sewing it to the plaid in the \"reverse applique\" technique. In some of the large areas commercially printed fabric was cut out and sewn down.  Fine yellow and light blue lines are embroidered in buttonhole stitch and dark blue lines in couched cord.  The banding of the edges is a patchwork of the more commercially printed fabrics.",
