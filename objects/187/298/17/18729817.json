    "justification": "from acquisition file:\ncontext: \nLino Sabattini has been one of Italy's leading silversmiths and designers, active in the design of silver, metalwork, and ceramics (Rosenthal) for half a century. He is self-taught, sharpening his sensibilities and craft while a young man during World War II. He read the design magazine Domus; studies materials and metalsmithing techniques in a brassware shop where he works, and later served an informal apprenticeship with refugee German ceramist, Roland Hettner. It was during that period that Sabattini first became interested in shapes dervied from the behavior of materials.\nBy 1955, he settled in Milsan where he met Gio Ponti who encouraged him and exhibited his work in the following year, which brought him to international attention. From 1956-63, while still active in Miland he was the Diroce of Desing for Christofle Orfevrerie, Paris. His silver designs during that period could be characterized as sculptural and free-flowing. Sabattini established his own manufactory in Bregnano, near Como, Italy in 1964, and started to garner awards in that decade. His standards of quality and his individual approach to the &quot;language of design&quot; have made him one of the leading figures in Italian modernism. \nobject:\nThe four vessels of Sabattini's &quot;Stairs&quot; tea and coffee set are plays on the circle and curve. The wall of the sugar bowl is a simple cylinder, while the taller pieces are formed of convex and concave curves, allowing the objects to nest into one another. Exploiting the highly reflective, unadorned curved and polished surface of silver-plated sheet metal, Sabattini investigares the basic shapes of the circle and curved line, and how these simple geometric forms can be arranged in a variety of configurations. Each piece is a different height. In one preparatory drawing, Sabattini shows the group in a tight arrangement creating a sprial, the stepped vessel tops suggesting staris. The cirlce theme is even carried throught the curved horizontal or vertical handles. \nJustification for the collection:\nAlthough Cooper-Hewitt has examples of Sabattini's metalwork (his 1975 &quot;Centro&quot; bowl, and the 1976 &quot;Estro&quot; sauceboat, along with drawings for both, all gifts of the designer) the &quot;Stairs&quot; set offered today is an earlier design. The elements of &quot;Stairs&quot; show the interaction of multiple objects conceived as a suite--discreet design objects that form a compostion when put together. ",
