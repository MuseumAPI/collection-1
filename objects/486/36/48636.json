  "description": "A tree with two birds upon a pole is shown at left.  A Chinese with a bow is running at its base toward some decayed planks leading to rock.  Motifs of Chinoiserie landscapes are distributed in the middle distance, in the center of which a Mandarin gets his tea on top of a tree.  The zigzag boardwalk leads on from there toward a tent with worshippers before an altar.",
