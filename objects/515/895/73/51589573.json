    "justification": "As a young industrial designer in the 1980s Naoto Fukasawa made a point of traveling to Akihabara, Japan, a town full of appliance and consumer electronics stores, where he could study a broad range of various manufactures appliances and electronics to get a sense of product types, advances in materials and technologies, and compare functions and stylistic trends and the work of other designers. This helped him as he developed his design philosophy, particularly the importance of the relationship between the user and the object. \nTelevisions seemed to be particularly telling. &amp;nbsp;Fukasawa observed that \u201cOf all electronic devices, the evolution of the television is significant: it is synonymous with high-tech products and is one of the most popular products.\u201d Although CRT (cathode ray tube) technology for use in televisions has been largely replaced by flat screen LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, Fukasawa still finds the CRT shape attractive, \u201clike a big square light bulb.\u201d Fukasawa\u2019s, portable LCD TV for Plus Minus Zero is shaped like the old CRT. This is ironic, since designing a TV housing shaped like this fitting snuggly around an actual CRT would be impossible. The housing can only be designed in the CRT shape because it incorporates an LCD flat screen, a technology first developed in the early twentieth century, but that became commercially viable only in the mid-1990s, and at that point&amp;nbsp;took off, particularly for use in laptop computers, flat panel computer screens, and large flat screen televisions. &amp;nbsp;\nFukasawa thinks of this miniature CRT-shaped design as friendly, particularly suited for a kitchen, or above a bed or other personal space, but of course it can be carried and pugged in for use in any room. The form is produced in red, white, or black, with a discreet row of control buttons in the same color, along the top of the housing. The TV is supplemented by a remote control and wireless transmitter.",
