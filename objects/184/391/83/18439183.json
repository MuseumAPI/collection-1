    "description": "Panel of chintz with a large scale, symmetrical arrangement of curving bands forming arcs which frame stylized plant and flower forms; heavy broad leaves cross the arcs, projecting into adjoining design areas. The curved bands and many of the parts of the leaves and other design areas are painted with fillings: dots, minute squares, and triangles in precise arrangements. In the arcs, areas of small scale, hexagonal-sided net suggest the ground of lace, with heavy points at one side and the inner sides of the arcs edged with fine points. The colors are predominantly red, soft green for leaves and centers of stems; yellow, violet, and some blue occur; some overpainting of blue lines on red leaves. Much of the painting of the small fillings is in brown.",
