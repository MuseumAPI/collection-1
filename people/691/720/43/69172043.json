    "biography": "Gareth Pugh\u2019s work resonates a dark, ebullient drama. Since his launch in London in 2005, the Central Saint Martins graduate has presented some of today\u2019s most avant-garde ready-to-wear collections. Replete with spectacle from the start\u2014inflated clothing, Elizabethan ruffs, obscured models\u2014Pugh\u2019s clothing is bold and uninhibited. In 2008, he received the Association Nationale pour le D\u00e9veloppement des Arts de la Mode award, among the fashion industry\u2019s most prestigious prizes. Pugh\u2019s collections emphasize feminine strength while supplying a protective armor composed of structured silhouettes. His garments often contrast black and white, fantasy and severity, softness and aggression. An emotional intensity bubbles from these oppositional forces, suggesting a space that Pugh\u2019s longtime collaborator, Matthew Stone, calls \u201cbeyond; a space that relates to the sublime.\"",
