    "description": "Low, thick, glossy white bowl-like form with circular slit at the bottom of the center depression, for the discharge of steam.",
    "justification": "The purpose of a humidifier is simple: restore the proper degree of humidity to dry air. In recent years, consumers have increasingly used&amp;nbsp;humidifiers in the home and workplace for their perceived health benefits, such as reduced sinus and respiratory problems, and added warmth in cold dry interiors particularly during the winter. Humidifiers function on a simple principal as well: hold a water supply, heat the water, discharge steam. Given that a humidifier is an appliance that is often kept in plain sight, surprisingly, there is no standard form. Manufacturers produce humidifiers in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials, and while most are very functional they are often unattractive and are not designed to harmonize with interiors, particularly domestic settings.\n&amp;nbsp;\nAlthough Fukasawa\u2019s humidifier has been likened to a drop of water, in designing it, he said since there was no iconic shape that signified \u201cHumidifier,\u201d he felt any form would do. The one thing he did want was to strengthen the impression that this was a humidifier by having the steam rise from the center of the appliance. He thought that a form based on a receptacle associated with water would be conceptually right: in this case, a \u201cshiny bulblike form reminiscent of porcelain,\u201d a material that also has a long history of being used for vessels&amp;nbsp;that hold hot liquids. Fukasawa also wanted his design to enrich a space whether it was in use or not, like a well-designed vase when it is either full of flowers or empty. To create&amp;nbsp;a durable plastic humidifier body with a porcelain-like appearance, Fukasawa employs a combination of mass-production techniques and hand crafting. The seam where the humidifier\u2019s molded top and bottom sections are joined is smoothed and minimized, the sections are bonded then painted, and finally, the humidifier is polished by hand. The small, glossy, rounded form comes in six colors, and is intended to blend into any space.",
