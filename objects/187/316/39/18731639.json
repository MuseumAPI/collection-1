    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;With the purchase of the century-old Whitefriars Glass works in 1834, James Powell, a successful wine merchant, created James Powell &amp; Sons at the beginning of an era of critical examination of design standards in Britain.&amp;nbsp; A year later, due to&amp;nbsp; widespread concern over the quality of British manufactured goods, when compared with foreign and especially French imports,&amp;nbsp; the government&amp;nbsp; set up the &quot;Select Committee on Arts and Manufactures&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Their report, published in 1836, resulted in national schools of design that exist to the present day.&amp;nbsp; These schools aimed to compete with those on the continent&amp;nbsp; emphasizing quality over quantity, particularly focussing on domestic wares.&amp;nbsp; Because Powell&amp;nbsp; was au courant with foreign taste and productiont,&amp;nbsp; the firm quickly gained a reputation for producing&amp;nbsp; high quality&amp;nbsp; work both from a design and technical point of view.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With the rise of Henry Cole as design-reformer and Powell's espousal of Cole's concept of artist-designer at the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, Powell broadened its success, being awarded a prize for its &quot;fine crystal glass&quot; at the exhibition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, during the late 1850's, it was its association with the Pre-Raphaelite artists, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Morris, and their maxims of &quot;truth to nature&quot; and &quot;honesty of purpose&quot; that led to the profound changes that mark the best of Powell glass, not for cut glass but for its creative designs and execution of forms and coloration.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Powell, in its commitment to &quot;truth to materials&quot; introduced soda glass as a replacement for lead glass, the former enabling it to create paper-thin objects decorated with fragile, applied threads of glass. Following the lead of Alexander Pellat at the Great Exhibition, Powell looked to Venetian glass, especially of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as the source of inspiration, turning away from cut glass to follow Ruskin's dicta, from The Stones of Venice (1853) about glass: &quot;its ductility when heated and its transparency when cold&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Ruskin also continued by saying &quot;all cut glass is barbarous&quot;, a statement that must have had impact on the Powell firm, as it did throughout the world of art nouveau glass later in the century.&amp;nbsp; Harry Powell, grandson of James, attended Ruskin's Oxford lectures as an undergraduate in the 1870's and subsequently wrote Glass-making in England (1923) in which he highlights the contributions of Venetian-born Jacob Verzelini&amp;nbsp; in late sixteenth century London, to the advancement of&amp;nbsp; English glass production.&amp;nbsp; The combination of his chemistry studies at Oxford with his own artistic talent made him an ideal designer for the firm, understanding both the artistic and technical aspects of the medium.t was Harry, who as a third generation in the business with his older cousin James Crofts Powell, started to assume responsibility for the firm in the 1870's.&amp;nbsp; Both men produced historic designs in the 1880's, Harry being encouraged by James who did a series of sketches in 1889 in Dutch museums that were directly translated into production; however, other design productions were composites.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition, the not all of these sketches were of actual glasses, some were from paintings. The glass beaker in the group being offered is very similar to one in a painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder of 1528, which was copied by Harry Powell in 1906, although it is also similar to some of James Crofts Powell's drawings of 1889 from actual examples and from paintings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Whitefriars archive has numerous further drawings from Dutch, German and English sources, making exact dating of our designs possible with further research.&amp;nbsp; This historical interest resulted in a series of the 1890's called &quot;Glasses with Histories&quot; designed by Harry, who was the company's chief designer of the 1890-1910 period, also the period when most of these designs were produced.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, various other styles and colorations were popular, including opalescent, melted-in and thread-striated glass in forms that reflect the organic nature of art nouveau with Venetian glass-making sensibilities. This group of glass enables us to have a look at the creative range of James Powell &amp; Sons from the designs of the 1870's to works that were produced until around 1930-predominantly during the period when Harry Powell was the chief designer at the firm.&amp;nbsp; The opalescent and yellow-green glass is similar to that on the W.A. S.&amp;nbsp; Benson lamp recently acquired by Cooper-Hewitt, not surprisingly as that is almost certainly a piece of Powell glass. Harry Powell and William Benson, who were friends, collaborated with Harry Powell in designing metal structures for Powell glass as well as numerous metal light fixtures using Powell glass.&amp;nbsp; They created a special pavilion for the Glasgow International exhibition of 1901 displaying some joint projects.&quot;",
