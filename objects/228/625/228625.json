  "description": "One layer of a knitted fabric is stretched under tension. A layer of polyester chiffon is layered on top. An adhesive is screen printed on in a pattern, permeating both fabric layers. Rayon fibers are sprinkled on and made to stand up as pile using an electric charge (flocking). The tension is released on the lower layer of fabric, causing the chiffon layer to pucker all around the flocked motifs. (a) is black with light green chiffon and black flocking; (b) is black with white chiffon and tan flocking.",
