    "justification": "Marc Berthier\u2019s Tykho radio for Lexon has been noted in the mainstream and design presses\u2014and the consumer electronics marketplace\u2014since its introduction in 1997. That year, and recently\u2014perhaps due to its fifteen-year anniversary\u2014it has appeared in \u201cTop Ten\u201d design lists in US magazines and newspapers. In 2000, Time magazine featured the radio on its March 20th cover, sitting in a round glass bowl filled with a few inches of water, above the headline, \u201cThe Rebirth of Design.\u201d Below the image, the text read: \u201cFunction is out. Form is in. From radios to cars to toothbrushes, America is bowled over by style.\u201d The reappearance of the Tykho radio across blogs and magazines in the last few years shows the design\u2019s lasting impact. \nThe Tykho\u2019s small, simple, monochromatic block-like form takes minimalism to an extreme.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The water and shock resistant body is ABS plastic covered by a smooth injection-molded, nearly seamless, silicon rubber shell.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's radio functions are pared down to a bare minimum\u2014no programmable channels, no earphone jack, no lighted dials or displays, no handle. Tuning is achieved by rotating the short antenna on the top right. The composition of the radio\u2019s functions and controls is organized and clear: the form is divided into quadrants, the left dominated by the outline of a large circular speaker, the right containing small button-like volume and tuning controls. All these elements are center-aligned giving a visual balance to the radio\u2019s face. &amp;nbsp;Berthier\u2019s visual and tactile cues for the user carry through to the design of the skin-like silicon rubber buttons, making the AM\/FM switch two separate raised disks and the volume control a linked button, a subtle reminder that the former are distinct functions while the latter represents two ends of a range. The sleek severity of the Tykho radio\u2019s form is relieved by the intense candy-like colors in which Lexon produced the radio, including red, blue, yellow, white, and brown, that also serve as a reminder that the radio is ultimately a form of entertainment.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lexon-design.com\/http:\/\/www.lexon-design.com\/la42r8-tykho-radio-red.html\">http:\/\/www.lexon-design.com\/la42r8-tykho-radio-red.html<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lexon-design.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/POMPIDOU-02.jpg\">http:\/\/www.lexon-design.com\/wp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/POMPIDOU-02.jpg<\/a>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/covers\/0,16641,20000320,00.html\">http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/covers\/0,16641,20000320,00.html<\/a> \nLindwell, William, and Manacsa, Gerry.
