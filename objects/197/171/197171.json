  "description": "This hand drawn and hand-labeled diagram of the M&Co offices located on West 57th Street, reproduced on the recto of an accordion-folded sheet of paper, was distributed to visitors on the occasion of a studio tour on May 20, 1987.  Perhaps the layout shown in the present object has some relationship to actual M&Co premises; however, the humorous labeling - for example, in Portfolio Green Room w/ Pathetic Rietveld Knock-Off; Proposed M&Co Gift and Souvenir Gift Shop - is entirely fictitious. \r\n\r\nWith the object folded, the front page, imprinted in a typewriter font, reads \r\n5 c [ents] (just below the top edge)/ Souvenir (further down, but within the top half)/ M&Co/ Map and Guide)/ AIGA House Tour (close to the bottom edge)/ May 20, 1987.",
