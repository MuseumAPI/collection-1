    "justification": "This elegant flagon by&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;important nineteenth century American silversmith is an excellent example of a piece of American silver that uses modern technology and historic design elements. The former is represented by the technique of spinning to create the hollow bowl, as opposed to traditional raising methods. Spinning, while done on a machine, is hand-controled and only as good as the silversmith who holds it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This interest in combining modern techniques with the tenets of arts and crafts is one that Christopher Dresser helped introduce in England in the mid-nineteenth century as part of the reaction to the machine-made object, but without William Morris's abhorence of any mechanical aid. The use of plain surfaces is one that Krider would have gleaned from his days with R &amp; W Wilson, silversmiths for whom he worked before setting out on his own, as they believed in creating pieces where only the patron's initials were featured, on various forms that let the silver shine on smooth surfaces.\nTrue to its age, the flagon combines different periods of sources into a harmonious whole. The&amp;nbsp;rococo scroll handle, emanates out of a baluster form with&amp;nbsp;no Gothic arches. The Gothic decoration is provided by the finely engraved inscription band around the waist, which, atypically of Gothic revival design constitutes the decoration.&amp;nbsp; The Maltese cross that forms the finial is an example of&amp;nbsp; form creating design, and may have some significance as Krider was a Freemason.&amp;nbsp; The function of the flagon is not totally clear but may relate to a rite of that organization, as the inscription is from the old Testament and has nothing to do with the Communion service.",
