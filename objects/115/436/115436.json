  "description": "On an off-white background, Pickwick, curved upward, is imprinted across in black serif style capitals. Centered directly underneath, the gilt-colored design is composed of Lager, in somewhat smaller capitals, heading a heraldic composition in silhouette; the central image is a crown-and-shield, flanked by a lion and a reindeer, both in profile and standing on the ends of a curved ribbon, labeled 1870 in the center; beer, imprinted in three-dimensional style capitals, is superimposed on the diagonal, rising upward from left to right. Haffenregger, in an ornate black script, is imprinted across beneath the ribbon. The label is bordered in gilt and imprinted in black capitals A Premium Light Dry Lager Beer along the top and with additional product information along the sides and on the bottom.\r\n\r\nAlbum, page 5.",
