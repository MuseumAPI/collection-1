    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Clara Barck Welles left her native Oregon to study at the Art Institute of Chicago. She opened the Kalo (from the Greek word for beauty) Shop in Chicago in 1900. \nAfter her 1905 marriage to Welles, she turned exclusively to metalwork design. The Kalo community also included apprentices since the School of Art Institute had since discontinued offering metalwork instruction. \nThese wonderful salad servers, having a distinctive shape, with the subtle distinction between the fork and spoon, with curved slits for the fork that discreetly cut into the spade shape. The date can be confirmed from thier rare makr of &quot;Hand Beaten&quot;, which was added to objects around 1910. It was then dropped in 1914 in favor of &quot;Handwrought.&quot; The serves also have an applied initial on the handle. An almost idenititcal part, also with an applied initial, is in the Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection of the High Museum in Atlanta. It is illustrated, with related salad bowl with initials dated 1911, as catalogue number 208 in Donald Pierce, Art and Enterprise, American Decorative Art 1825-1917. The Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection, Atlanta 1999, p. 348. \nThe style for the initials, for which the Chicago Arts and Crafts movement became justifiably known, related greatly to the architectural styling in the city and is a significant element of the Chicago Arts and Crafts style.&quot;",
