    "biography":"Rhodes studied at the Royal College of Art in London and majored in printed textiles. By the 1970s, she was at the forefront of British fashion with her bold, dynamic, colorful and feminine prints that were seen as anti-establishment in Great Britain.  In 1969, Rhodes set up her own studio and then took a collection to New York where it was featured in American Vogue. As her name became more recognized, she began supplying her work to major American department stores, like Neiman Marcus. She was considered the \u201cPrincess of Punk\u201d for her use of tears, holes, and safety pins in her garments. Rhodes has designed jewelry, wrapping paper, and costumes for operas in the United States. She was a also a founder of the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, which opened in 2003.",
