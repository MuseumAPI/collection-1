    "description": "The engraving shows a clock consisting of two large opposing double scrolls framing the face, which includes two needles, decorative acanthus foliage and Roman numerals. Beneath it in the center, a cherub drums on two tambourines, the lower half of his body transforming into arabesques that fill the space around him. The crowning of the clock is shaped into a curvilinear dome and includes four fire urns with swags. The clock sits atop a stand with central mask in a shell, from which emerge two thick oak leaf swags on either side of it, both attached to the center of a volute at either end of the stand.",
