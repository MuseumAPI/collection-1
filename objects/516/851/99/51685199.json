    "justification": "The Landi chair was one of the first highly successful designs for seating furniture using aluminum sheeting, a new material in the 1930s. Introduced at the 1939 Swiss National Exhibition (Schweizerische Landesaustellung) in Zurich, the chair was the official seating for the grounds. The seat and back are made of a single aluminum sheet, stamped into shape and perforated with circular holes, and the arm-and-leg elements are formed of thin bent aluminum strips. The Landi was probably based on seats designed for aircraft, an area in which aluminum was already used extensively by the late 1930s. The use of aluminum made the chair extremely light weight and weather resistant, allowing it to be portable, stackable, and practical for both indoor and outdoor use, while the perforations allowed rain or melting snow to drain through. The Landi has been in continuous production since 1939. In 1962 the manufacturer changed the number and arrangement of the perforations, reducing the rows from 13 to 10, and the number of holes from 91 to 60. This enabled mass production rather than individual processing, made the seat less springy, and reduced a tendency for cracking in the curve where the back transitions into the seat.&amp;nbsp; In 1971, the Italian firm Zanotta S.p.A. began marketing the chair as the \u201c2070 Spartana.\u201d&amp;nbsp; The chair being offered in this gift is from the pre-1962 Blattmann production showing the original number of perforations.",
