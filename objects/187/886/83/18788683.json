    "description": "Chair design in form of a growing tree or bush with crossing and intertwined veins forming seat and back. Two sketches at right of leaves intertwined and branching twigs.",
    "justification": "This developmental drawing by the sibling design team of Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec relates to their Vegetal Chair, which was acquired by the museum in 2010. The birth of the Vegetal Chair dates back to 2006, when the Bouroullec brothers came up with the concept of a chair that \u201cgrows.\u201d They conceived of the legs moving upwards, branching out to form the seat, and meandering up again to form the back and arms. Their initial three-dimensional model was asymmetrical and led them back to the drawing board, especially to concentrate on determining the right number of branching elements and how best to incorporate a symmetrical, stable substructure for the chair to evenly support a person\u2019s weight. They focused on the ergonomics necessary to ensure a comfortable seat and back, which they accomplished by reducing the number of branches and flattening them on the interior while retaining the branch texture on chair\u2019s exterior.\nThe drawing proposed for acquisition is from October 2005. It is one of three drawings from early in the chair\u2019s development drawn in felt tip marking pen\u2014Ronan\u2019s preferred drawing tool. It shows the initial concept of the chair in perspective with two smaller sketches investigating the overlapping growth structure of leaves and a branching vine. \nNature has consistently been a source of design inspiration and an influence on the decorative arts. As part of the museum\u2019s mission to explore the design continuum, this process drawing would be very useful both for pedagogic and exhibition purposes. This would be the first drawing by the Bouroullec brothers in the museum\u2019s collection and, to the best of our knowledge, the first drawing by the Bouroullec brothers to enter a museum collection in the United States or Europe.",
    "gallery_text": "Nature as an inspiration for design has been a source for the decorative arts over many centuries. French brothers Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec, working together since 1998, used nature as the foundation for their Vegetal chair (produced by Vitra in 2009 )\u2014whose structure mimics the growth of tree branches or the veins of a leaf. Drawings are a substantial part of the pair\u2019s day-to-day studio work and this 2005 drawing done in felt tip marking pen and created early in the chair\u2019s development shows the initial concept of a naturally \u201cgrown\u201d chair. Emerging from the legs, the plastic stalks weave into an irregular-shaped, latticed seating surface. The designers shifted between two and three dimensions, making several drawings and prototypes over the four years they spent on the project,  which marries an organic form with technical feasibility and functionality.",
    "label_text": "The Bouroullec brothers created this form compelled by the thought of a chair that would \u201csprout up like a plant . . . with its branches gently curving up to form the seat and back.\u201d As this early drawing suggests, they conceived of the legs moving upward, branching out to form the seat, and meandering up again to form the back and arms. The final structure resembles an overlapping series of flattened branches that embrace the sitter.",
