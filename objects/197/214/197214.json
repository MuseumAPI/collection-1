  "description": "On a black background, four M&Co Labs products (three rulers and one wristwatch),  posed on two male hands, are photographed. Across the top of the page, one hand, palm outward, is stretched across. A partial view of a ruler, beginning at the left edge and extending horizontally, overlays the wrist, which is in shadow; the fingers curve around a partial view of a second ruler, in its case, slanting diagonally from the top edge to the right edge on the upper half of the page. A second hand, palm outward, fingers splayed and thumb stretched upward, occupies the lower half of the page. The M&Co Ten One 4 wristwatch, its face visible to the viewer, is worn on the wrist. A third ruler, inches one to six visible, overlays the hand at the base of the fingers and extends downward to the bottom edge. In white sans serif type, a page-length list of stores on the right and three additional paragraphs placed at intervals on the left complete the design. The M&Co Labs logo appears just above the bottom edge on the left.",
