  "description": "The present object, here stored flat, is a label designed to wrap a rectangular can with rounded corners. The type is white throughout and the background, except for the product photograph, is pale purple. Below a narrow strip at the top imprinted with the manufacturer's name, Arbogast & Bastian Inc., are two side by side identical color photographs, each featuring a platter covered with sliced meat garnished with sprigs of a dark green leafy vegetable. Just below the top edge of the photograph, A Suggestion For Serving is imprinted; the product logo, A & B, in serif-style block letters, is superimposed on the meat at the center. A wide light band stretching across below the photograph is imprinted Luncheon/ Meat in serif-style type; additional type provides product details. Perpendicular to and between the photographs are six lines of type headed Serving Suggestions. A decorative rick rack pattern in light purple and gray is located where the two halves of the label meet when positioned on the can.",
