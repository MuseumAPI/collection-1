  "description": "This view shows a typical room in a vicar's home, comfortably furnished at little expense. The wicker chair, large plant in a terra-cotta pot, casually upholstered day bed and patterned walls and floor create a somewhat nondescript, yet cozy, interior. Elements of the Aesthetic Movement appear in the side chair rail and ceiling moldings.",
