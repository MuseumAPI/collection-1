    "justification": "The Specimen poster was featured in the Graphic Design Now exhibition and is depicted on the catalogue\u2019s cover.&amp;nbsp; Particularly engaging is the way the dog-earned lower right corner is folded back to reveal the poster\u2019s text advertising a series of exhibitions on editorial design in 2008 in the town of Chaumont, France.&amp;nbsp; To the average viewer the tapestry of colorful geometric signs resembles a diagram of a microchip.&amp;nbsp; To the initiated graphic designer, however, these symbols are recognizable as the various printers\u2019 control marks.&amp;nbsp; According to Mellier, she decided to print the text on the folded corner because she didn\u2019t want it to interrupt the tapestry like effect and to force the viewer to fold the paper to get the information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The poster won second prize at the 2011 Chaumont Poster Festival.",
