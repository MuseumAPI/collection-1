    "justification": "Justification taken from Acquisition file\nThis stool, from the Robert Winn house in Kalamazoo, Michigan, is a simple form that Wright designed for his Usonian dwellings.&amp;nbsp; The term Usonia came from Samuel Butler's utopian novel Erewhon; Wright used the term to refer to the low cost, utilitarian housing and furnishings that were his efforts at promoting a democratic and cooperative way of life.&amp;nbsp; The aim of the Usonian home was to provide an inexpensive residence that would encourage an informal style of domestic life, reflected in the simple forms and components of the interiors and the furniture.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the furniture was designed to be fabricated by local carpenters and craftsmen, and was spec'd for inexpensive sheet-wood construction and simple upholstery, as seen in this example.\nCooper-Hewitt has a small group of Wright objects, including ceramics and three side chairs and a table, from the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (designed ca. 1920).&amp;nbsp; The stool relates very closely to a ca. 1950 Wright chair (1997-90-1) in the collection, said to come from the Winn house.&amp;nbsp; The chair's frame is also of flat, sheet-wood construction, but the base is a variation on the boxy form of the stool, having four legs, shaped as triangular panels, flaring out from the corners of a central rectangular panel.&amp;nbsp; This stool is a fine addition to the Museum's material by Frank Lloyd Wright, complimenting the Usonian chair and helping to broaden our picture of this important American architect and designer's later career.",
