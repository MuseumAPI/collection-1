  "description": "Horizontal rectangle. The sepulchrum stands as a sarcophagus in the hollow of the mensa, framed laterally by panels. In the center of the furniture rises the tabernacle, having laterally two angels with candle brackets. At right, beside the mensa, is another project for the tabernacle. It has the shape of a canopy hanging from a crown which is supported by the arms of two standing angels who open the curtain with their hands. A chalice seems to be represented upon the door. The dimensions are described in the project at left. Above and below are pencil outlines of architectural details with some measurements. Written above, at right: \"4\", and in the lower right corner, vertically: \"61\".",
