    "title": "Energizing the Everyday: Gifts From the George R. Kravis II Collection",
    "text": "Energizing the Everyday: Gifts From the George R. Kravis II Collection\nEnergizing the Everyday celebrates the collecting vision of George R. Kravis II and its synergy with Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum's broad and diverse collection of modern and contemporary design. An early interest in records and a background in broadcasting inform Kravis's enthusiasm for and knowledge of radios, televisions, and technology. As Kravis's passion for design grew, he expanded his collecting efforts beyond American electronic devices to include industrial design and furnishings for the home and office from America, Europe, and Asia. This exhibition showcases highlights of the Kravis collection dating from the early 20th century to the present. From industrial design and furniture to tableware and textiles, the exhibition makes visual and material connections across time and geography. \nAs a collector, Kravis is interested in the object's user, purpose, process, and manufacturing while also considering form and substance. The good design of these objects enhanced the day-to-day activities of the home and workplace, as well as during travel and leisure. The rigid geometry of Norman Bel Geddes's skyscraper-like ca.1931 Manhattan Cocktail Set, the humor of Cesare Cassati's and C. Emanuele Ponzio's 1968 Pillola Lamps, and the social concerns reflected in Olafur Eliasson's Little Sun Solar Powered LED Lantern of 2012 are among the many historic and contemporary themes enlivened in Energizing the Everyday.",
