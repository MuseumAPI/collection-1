    "biography": "The idea for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was primarily that of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan. MoMA acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. The museum's permanent and current home was designed in the International Style by the modernist architects Philip L. Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone, and opened to the public on May 10, 1939.  MoMA's collection (of almost 200,000 objects) covers a wide range of visual expressions, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art. The museum's archives hold primary source material related to the history of modern and contemporary art.",
