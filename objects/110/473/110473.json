One end of each branch turns into a grimacing beast whose tongue is being grasped by a standing winged cupid. The positive space in the design is the natural linen foundation; the negative space is solidly worked yellow silk long-legged cross-stitch. The design is outlined and accented by blue silk outline stitch, and there is a short thick blue and yellow silk fringe on three sides.",
