She studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, The School of Design, also spending time at the Finnish University of Art and Design in Helsinki as an exchange student. In 1998, soon after finishing school, Manz started her own design studio in Copenhagen. Her designs include objects for the home, ranging from furniture, to glass and tableware, lighting, bags and boxes. Manz\u2019s primary concern is user experience. She champions functionality and lasting objects rather than ephemeral, trendy products. Manz clients include a number of Dutch and Swedish brands, including Holmegaard, Lightyears, Nils Holger Moormann, Fritz Hansen and Bang & Olufsen.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ceciliemanz.com\/About\nhttp:\/\/www.fritzhansen.com\/en\/designers\/cecilie-manz\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cecilie_Manz",
