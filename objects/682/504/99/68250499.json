    "description": "with turned legs and uprights champfered at the angles, the chairback with slight back angle connected by horizontal slats, the seat with woven close-caning in a twill weave, the chair legs connected with slat-form stretchers, one on front and back, two on each side.",
    "justification": "The Superleggera epitomizes the co-existence of artisanal and industrial production&amp;nbsp;in post-war Italy. The chair was inspired by 19th-century Italian ladderback chairs with woven straw seats. The frame was mass-produced in by the Cassina factory in Meda, Italy, but the caning was done by women (impagliatrice) in traditional workshops. The seat is close-caned in a twill weave. It uses very narrow widths of cane nailed to the chair rails, without the need for drilling. \nFirst established in the late eighteenth century, the firm had been taken over by brothers Cesare and Umberto Cassina in 1927. While Cassina progressed from artisanal to industrial scales of production in the 1940s, skilled craftsmen continued to define Cassina's workforce and were indispensable in its manufacturing process. Umberto Cassina said of the firm's head carpenter, Fausto Redaelli: 'without him, the Superleggera could not exist.' &amp;nbsp;Artisanal skills were instrumental to increase lightness of the chair. Despite describing the Leggera as 'ultra light' in Domus, in the early 1950s Ponti wrote to Cassina to ask him to 'affettare' (slice up) the Leggera to make it\u2019s frame elements even thinner. The final result was the Superleggera, a chair that combined aesthetic and actual lightness - it weighs just 3.10 pounds, and its triangular tapered legs have a maximum diameter of just 18 mm.\nThe Superleggera is one of the icons of post-war Italian design and arguably the most well known example of furniture design by leading Italian architect Gio Ponti. The culmination of a near decade of research to create the lightest chair possible, Cassina put the chair into production in 1957, and they still manufacture the chair today. The Superleggera was nominated for the prestigious Compasso D'Oro design award on its release.",
