    "biography":"Anna Maria Garthwaite was a freelance designer and worked in Spitalfields, an area outside of London where the silk industry was centered, from 1728 to 1756.  Not much is known of her schooling; however, it is clear that she was well learned in her craft. A tremendously prolific designer, she averaged about 80 designs per year. She typically wrote the name of the weaver to whom the design was sold.",
