    "description":"Oblong pillow cover of fine linen, embriodered in black silk. A design of scrolling stems and flowers originates in the center and flows, symmetrically left and right. Thin vine stems scroll to frame clusters of honeysuckle, strawberries (?) and leaves. A cluster of leafs and berries forms each corner. The vine stems and outlines of flowers and leaves are in a twisted stitch forming a fine cord; leaves and blossoms ornamented with many diaper fillings in running and cross-stitch. The bottom edge shows remains of black silk handstitch. On reverse at one end, the top is longer than backing, and was apparently where pillow slipped in.",
