The buliding has a tiled roof, balcony, and stairway leading to the right.  It appears that there are two window openings above and a two doorways below.  Two columns standing one on top of the other are also represented.  Separate from this to the right is a view of the same stairway but seen in elevation, as one would walk up the stairs, thus the roofline is depicted here as sloping down, and the columns are seen at the right of the stairs.",
