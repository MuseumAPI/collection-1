    "description":"Four shelf designs. From left to right, the squares of the shelves progressively get smaller. First from left: large grid shelving unit; second: two roughly overlapping grid shelving units making the squares smaller, with books, a potted plant, a frame; third:  two roughly overlapping grid shelving units making the squares even smaller, with an alarm clock, a frame, and books; fourth: two grid shelving units completely overlap each other with all previously-noted objects.",
    "justification":"This drawing is a preparatory work for the design of \u201cscatter shelf,\u201d a storage unit composed of 5mm glossy black acrylic shelves that have been arranged as a grid, and then stacked in three, slightly off-kilter layers.&amp;nbsp; While the shelving unit remains structurally sound, the visual effect is kaleidoscopic, where the individual shelves appear to increase and decrease in volume depending on the viewer\u2019s vantage point.&amp;nbsp; nendo\u2019s founder, Oki Sato, has referred to the experience of this effect as appearing to be \u201ccaught in a spider\u2019s web.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Sato executed this drawing in preparation for the exhibition of a group of thirty-five \u201cscatter shelves\u201d at Friedman Benda gallery in New York.&amp;nbsp; The drawing was reproduced on the wall at the&amp;nbsp;entrance to the exhibition.&amp;nbsp; With its simple ink lines, the drawing lyrically depicts the layering of the grid structures to form the complete shelving unit.&amp;nbsp; ",
