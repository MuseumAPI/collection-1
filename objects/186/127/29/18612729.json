    "description":"Long coat of green-blue twill wool that is open down the front with long sleeves, lined with green-blue silk, and edged with red and blue silk. The coat is patterned with set-in shapes embroidered in multicolored wool along the opening down the front and sleeve bands. There are small medallions on shoulders and at the bottom corners of the front opening. There is a large medallion at the upper back near the near. The embroidered set-in pieces are probably from an older coat of higher quality, possibly 19th century. The foundation fabric of the embroidered shapes is a dull olive-green.",
