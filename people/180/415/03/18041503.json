She had been making jewelry since she was a small child and continued to do so when she moved to New York with her architect husband John. Eisler attended classes at Parsons School of Design and eventually became a teacher there, and later, chairman of the K. O. V. Studio (Concept Object Meaning). After 25 years in the United States, Eisler and her family moved back to Prague where she heads the Jewelry department at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design. She continues to make jewelry, as well as clothing and furniture.",
