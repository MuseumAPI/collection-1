    "description": "Man's prestige cloth composed of twenty-three narrow woven strips stitched selvedge to selvedge. Each strip is patterned with rectangular areas of warp-faced stripes weft-faced plain weave on grouped warps, and patterned weaves with two-color complementary wefts and brocading. The pattern blocks are arranged in a checkerboard fashion. Black, blue, green, yellow, and red, with a strong yellow-orange predominating.",

    "gallery_text": "The Asante strip-woven cloths commonly known as kente are among the most iconic and prestigious African textiles. The Asante have a powerful ruling court, and a large community of artisans work in the village of Bonwire in the service of the royals to produce the stunning visual displays expected for court occasions. \nThe complex interplay of designs is the result of alternating three different patterning systems: a balanced-weave check, weft-faced stripes, and supplementary weft zigzags. Because the cloth is woven in a single continuous strip, which is then cut into identical lengths, a checkerboard design like this one requires the weaver to carefully measure each pattern block while weaving to ensure that they align correctly when sewn together. The pattern is called susudua, for the measuring stick he uses.[1] \n\n\n\n\n[1] Malika Kraamer, \u201cGhanaian Interweaving in the Nineteenth Century: A New Perspective on Ewe and Asante Textile History,\u201d African Arts 39, no. 4 (Winter 2006): 51.",
