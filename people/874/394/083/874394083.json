    "biography": "Axel Russmeyer was born in 1964 in Oldesloe, Germany. He studied communication arts and received his degree in 1993, after which he began working as a freelance artist and designer. Russmeyer became very interested in the idea of beads as personal adornment and with the history of beads as historic objects, symbols, or amulets in different cultures. In his jewelry, Russmeyer works with a range of antique and contemporary beads and pearls to make conglomerate bead creations that he then fashions into jewelry. This compounded process reflects Russmeyer's dedication to detail in his work and his commitment to his artistic and aesthetic concepts. Russmeyer\u2019s work has been featured in many exhibitions and is included in the collections of museum in both Europe and the United States.",
