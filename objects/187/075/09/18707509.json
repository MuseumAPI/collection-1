    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot; Faience from Moustiers, France, a town in the Alpine are in the southeast of France, has been made since at least the late 16th century. The production of the dynsatic families of Clerissy, Olery, Laugier, grew to flourish in the proudction of high and low-temperature fired earthenwares of especially artistic creativity in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A prior economist of Italian origin, Lazzaro Porri, may well have brought to the Clerissy family the formula for tin-glazed enamel in 1671. To this technology was added artistic creativity, and, increasingly a new range of coloration as the eighteenth century developed.\nCertain motifs are associated with Moustiers and its environs, and engraved sources, such as Callot are frequent. These decorated ceramics were clearly sought after in their day, as evident by the signatures often gracing the wares, and of the industry that developed later both to continue and to imitate the styles, as well as the signatures of the eminent factory heads and decorators.&quot;",
