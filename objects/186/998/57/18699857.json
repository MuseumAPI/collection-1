    "justification": "Justification for acquisition file\nThe stool is a significant example of a functional piece designed by the contemporary artist, Robert Wilson, who is best known as a creator of experimental theater, a stage designer, performance artist, writer, painter, and print maker.&amp;nbsp; Born in Texas, Wilson studied at the University of Texas and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he became interested in architecture and design.\nWilson has been called one of America's foremost architecture-based contemporary chair designers, with a large following that crosses multiple boundaries between art and design.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;Queen&quot; stool would be a fine addition to Cooper-Hewitt's collection, adding to a group of artist-created pieces in the Department of Product Design and Decorative Arts, which includes ceramics designed by Picasso, the American contemporary artist Cindy Sherman, and, in our furniture collection, a mirror designed by Jim Dine.&amp;nbsp; The stool also relates to a group of 27 design sketches for theater sets, dating from 1990, acquired as a purchase by the Museum's Department of Drawings, Prints and Graphic Design (1992-90-1\/27).",
