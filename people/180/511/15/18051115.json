    "biography": "The Chemex Corporation emerged to refine, produce, and promote the Chemex Coffeemaker, a glass, manual pour-over coffeemaker invented by the chemist Peter Schlumbohm in 1941. The Chemex\u2019s wood collar and leather belt channel the Bauhaus school of design while the hourglass shape and glass material were inspired by non-porous labware; these were Schlumbohn\u2019s dual influences in designing the coffeemaker. The object is still produced by Chemex Corporation today, largely unaltered, and has received numerous honors from art and design institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Museum, Corning Museum of Glass, and Illinois Institute of Technology. Chemex Corporation continues to be a family-run operation although the Chemex brand is owned by Housewares International, based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, the manufactory that produces the coffeemaker.",
