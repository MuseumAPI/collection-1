    "description":"Recto: On a black background, Talking Heads, the letter A upside down, is imprinted in large capital letters in white across the entire top; the album title, centered, is imprinted in small capitals at bottom. The space between the two bands of type is occupied by four computer-enhanced images, representing the four musicians (three men and one woman); the faces are red and the features blue and black.\nVerso: The band's name is replicated as it appears on the recto. The bottom black band, in the same size as on the recto, instead shows the song titles, musicians' names and other production information in small white capitals. The design comprises a snowcapped mountain scene in brown, white, and sky blue; four red fighter planes in vertical formation and graduating in size are superimposed.",
