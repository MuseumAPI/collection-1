    "description": "Seemingly irregularly placed red flocked dots which form letters of the Braille alphabet, spelling out the \"listen and record\" process used in creating this design.",
    "justification": "This paper is from the designer's second collection, introduced in Tokyo in 2007. &quot;Listen and Record&quot;, which appears to be a nice textural composition, is actually telling the story in Braille about how this design was created. The designer recorded his voice every day over the course of a year. At the beginning of the second year, he listened to the tape from one year before, took a ten minute break, and then recorded his current thoughts over the original. The tape for February 29 will only get listened to every four years. The contents of the recordings vary as would the entries in a daily journal. \nTypography was used on children's papers going back to the 1870s, but served an instructional rather than decorative purpose. This paper is unique in that it presents characters from the Braille alphabet. &quot;Listen and Record&quot; examines design accessibility through role reversal. A visually impaired person can touch the wallpaper and read the story. Sighted observers cannot. They merely see a tactile pattern, but cannot comprehend the meaning. Listen and Record presents a unique take on typographic wallpapers and is the first wallpaper in our collection by an Australian designer. ",
