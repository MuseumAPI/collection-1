  "description": "This second part of a two-part invitation would have been wrapped together with the first part, then folded in sixths for mailing. The logo, centered in the top section, features a heart-and-circle superimposed on a shield-like shape, striped vertically. The whole is enclosed within a heart shape, formed by a chain in the upper half and a crossed branch-and-leaf design in the lower half. The initials, LB, with the L in reverse formation, are imprinted in the intersection of the branches. Just above the logo, the date of the event is imprinted within a curved strip, underneath which is a crown-shaped pictograph. The remainder of the page consists of details about the event, imprinted in varied type. The whole is surrounded by a border in a rope design.",
