    "description":"A central figure is seated on layers of geometric and vegetal carpets, wearing a short-sleeved robe composed of many male figures and animals that are constrained to the frame of the garment.  A garment like a coronet draped with a white cloth is worn upon the head.  The figure is holding in the right hand a small vessel with a bird perched upon the rim.  Laid upon a small carpet at the feet of the figure is a bowl of fruit, two small vessels, and a tall, handled ewer with elongated spout.  In the background (possibly viewed through a window?) is a large green mound framed by two trees in bloom, with clouds rendered to appear fast-moving.",
