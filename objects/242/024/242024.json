  "description": "Utilizing the German national colors, an Art Deco-like figure of Mercury spews out a visceral message - a reference perhaps to the charged atmosphere of the divided country's films in the era before Perestroika.  Bruhwiler's poster, in its Art Deco classicism, makes a pointed reference to Cassandre's masterful design for a French newspaper, Intransigeant. Text in bottom right in black and white reads: \"neue/ deutsche/filme/film-/podium\" with additional date and time information.",
