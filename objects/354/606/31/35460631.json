    "description":"In olive -almost chartreuse- green, with cylindrical base before an angled bottle-form bulbous upper body cut on the diagonal.",
    "justification":"John Nickerson was the first designer hired by Blenko with a pre-existing knowledge of the studio movement.&amp;nbsp; As a teacher and as a designer he was fully cognizant of the interest in using both ceramics and glass in new ways as personal artistic expressions. In this vase, whose polished diagonal cut&amp;nbsp;enables cut flowers to stand with support when arrayed in it, he plays with the idea of a bottle form. Later, &amp;nbsp;diagonal and other irregular cuts in contemporary shapes, often subverting functionality, were to become a feature of Nickerson's work.&amp;nbsp; This vase, which is functional,&amp;nbsp;is tooled while on the blowpipe rather than being transferred to a pontil rod, so no pontil mark is visible on the bottom.&amp;nbsp;Then, it is simply cut on the bias from near the neck.&amp;nbsp; This method of cold work&amp;nbsp; greatly added to the production expense and consequently this design was only produced for one year.",
