The desk in the far right corner is placed at a window to catch the light. A stag's head is mounted on the wall between the windows, while elk horns, pictures and a book shelf hang on the wall to the right. Blue tufted furniture, a patterned carpet and vases of flowers, all omnipresent elements of the Victorian period, are featured here.",
