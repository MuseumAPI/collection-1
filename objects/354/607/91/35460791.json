    "description": "depicting the temple in its semi-ruined state as visible in the 18th and early nineteenth centuries, showing the circular section building with columns ringing a central core, supporting an upper moulding",
    "justification": "This is an important example of a cork model, made in&amp;nbsp;either&amp;nbsp;Rome or Naples, &amp;nbsp;but generally for a foreign collector probably on the Grand Tour. The fashion for cork models started with the revival of interest in the classical period in the mid -eighteenth century and reached it zenith&amp;nbsp;around 1800-1830. &amp;nbsp;Meticulous workmanship and an exacting sense of proportion produced a model that was faithful to the full scale building.&amp;nbsp; To make the models, curved cork boards from Southern European cork trees were flattened in presses for an extended period, before being shaped and sculpted with sharp tools. The porous nature of cork was ideal for creating the impression of the worn marble of the original buildings, which was importance as scale and replicating the appearance were important. Its lightness made them more transportable.\nThese models were both used to &quot;collect&quot; important architecture, and to teach from. Architect Sir John Soane had a models room, from which he taught, that featured cork models of several important classical buildings. He looked on them as good substitutes for going on the Grand Tour from the point of view of&amp;nbsp;teaching architecture.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\nSeveral key figures are associated with the development of cork models: Augusto&amp;nbsp;Rosa (1738-1784), a&amp;nbsp;Roman architect who supplemented his practice&amp;nbsp;through production of cork models of ruins in and around Rome, sometime in the 1770's-80's&amp;nbsp;may&amp;nbsp;have been the primary inventor of&amp;nbsp;such exact architectural modelling in cork.&amp;nbsp;Other makers such as Giovanni Altieri (1767-1790) and Dominico Padiglione and sons&amp;nbsp;in Naples, ran workshops which&amp;nbsp;used measured drawings to produce models as well.&amp;nbsp; Others include, Antonio Chichi (1743-1816) and&amp;nbsp;a German&amp;nbsp;Carl May (1747-1822). While it is as yet not possible to definitely attribute this model, the location of the Temple of Vesta, in Tivoli,&amp;nbsp;not far from Rome, may suggest a Roman maker, such as Rosa.&amp;nbsp; \nI am grateful to Jonathan Coulborn of Thomas Coulborn, for his insight and scholarship on the subject of cork models.\n&amp;nbsp;",
