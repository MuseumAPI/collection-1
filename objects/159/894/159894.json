Red lettering with faint white outline centered on page; organic, distorted (nearly unreadable) letterforms spell out the names of bands stacked one on top of the other: The Association, Along Comes Mary, Quicksilver, Messenger Service, Grassroots, with \"Friday only\" at the bottom. The words look almost as though they are wrapped around an cylinder. At the top, in simple black san-serif all-caps: Presented in San Francisco by Bill Graham. At the bottom, in similar simple black text, a list of ticket outlets.",
