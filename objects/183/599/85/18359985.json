    "description": "Horizontal rectangle. Furniture design elevations in Neo-Greek style. At left is the right half of the sofa, supported by two legs. The chairs are seen from the front, the right one with curved legs. All three seats have the same upholstery. Above the two chairs is a rough outline of an armchair, seen from the side turned toward left. At right is the vanity table, whose left half is outlined in graphite as an alternative suggestion. No drawer is suggested. The two legs stand immediately on the floor at left and upon a base at right. A mirror is at the back.",
