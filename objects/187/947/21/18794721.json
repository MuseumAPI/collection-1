    "justification":"Lost Font, designed and produced by TAR ca. 2006, was commissioned by a rare book dealer, who wanted something that reflected his love of print. Using a drag box modified to create stripes, Tillett and Rauscher applied the black ink through a loosely woven jute mesh so that fragments of the woven structure appear. The cotton batiste was wetted immediately afterward, so that irregular bleeding of the ink occurs, creating a soft gray shadow around the staccato black marks. ",
