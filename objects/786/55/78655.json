  "description": "Vertical sheet with five sketches of architectural elements from buildings in Vannes, France.  Clockwise from upper left is the detail of a roof eave showing the practice of extending roof beams far out beyond the wall below and resting the roof rafters on a cross beam that then rests on the floor beams to create a deep shadow.  To the lower right of this is a slate gable with deep overhanging eave and half-timbered decoration below.  At the bottom right corner is a small dormer with a rounded front topped by a ball finial.  To the left of this is the meeting of two corners of a building producing a deep and unusual intersection of the eaves.  Above this is another rendering of this same detail that was sketched below.",
