    "description": "Bold design in red and black on white.  A black circle with Musykal'naia in white wrapping around a white circle with Nov in red.  This field is separated by a black bar from a lower rectangular field with 1924 in black, a central section (to be completed) and N 4, a black bar separates another field which says Moskva in black at left;   in red  at center; and   in black at right.",
    "justification": "While trained as a painter, Liubov Popova abandoned her painting career in 1921 for art that served the people and the communist State.  Strongly influenced by Kasimir Malevich and Alexandr Rodchenko, she applied a Constructivist aesthetic to her posters and other printed ephemera, textiles, stage design, clothing and ceramics.   Presented here is an issue of the Russian avant-garde journal, Muzykal\u2019naia nov\u2019 (Musical New Land), no. 4, 1924, with a cover by Popova.   This is a powerful graphic whose boldness and central focus approaches graphic designs of Rodchenko.  The Musical New Land journal is relatively rare, since only 1500 copies were printed.",
