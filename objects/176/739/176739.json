  "description": "Unfinished mourning sampler with a tree and a woman at a tomb with a large urn of flowering vines on top of it. The woman's apron is caught in the branches of this vine. There is no inscription on the tomb, and the woman's head is drawn on the cloth but not embroidered. \r\nAt the bottom, a text:\r\nWhen age shall steal on me and youth is no more\r\nAnd the moralist time shakes his glass at my door\r\nWhen charm in lost beauty or wealth shall I find\r\nMy treasure my wealth is a sweet peace of mind \r\n\r\n",
