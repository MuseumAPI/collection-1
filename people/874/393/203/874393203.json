In 1970, he had his final apprenticeship and became a goldsmith, working at various workshops in Z\u00fcrich and Bern. From 1972 to 1978, K\u00fcnzli studied at the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste M\u00fcnchen (Academy of Fine Arts Munich) in Munich under renowned German jeweler Herman J\u00fcnger, taking further classes in the goldsmith's craft. In 1975, he moved into his current residence in Munich, and established his studio. \n\nStill working in Munich today, K\u00fcnzli has become well known in the world of art jewelry for his minimal and conceptual pieces filled with wit and irony. His work has received many awards, including the Grand Prix of the Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft (Swiss Confederation) and the Ring of Honor from the Association for Goldsmiths\u2019 Art. His work is featured in many public collections, including the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Royal College of Art Collection in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.
