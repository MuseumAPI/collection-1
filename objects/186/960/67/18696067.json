    "justification":"\nThis textile was designed by Reiko Sudo (b. 1953), one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers. Educated at Musashino Art University, she and Junichi Arai co-founded the Japanese company and store, Nuno, which produces textiles of extraordinary ingenuity and beauty, in 1984. Sudo and the other designers at Nuno combine tradition and advanced technologies with remarkable creativity, which, over the last 20 years, has lead them to the forefront of textile design.&amp;nbsp; \nEmbossed Stainless Steel, designed by Sudo in 1990, is made exactly like Stainless Steel Gloss (2002-17-2), where the polyester filament of the textile has been woven, calendar pressed, and then it is spatter plated with stainless steel, except that in Stainless Steel Gloss an&amp;nbsp;additional embossing step has been added after the spatter-plating to create a semi-transparent fabric with a textured surface. This is a method of production used primarily in the automobile industry for plating car parts. This unusual combination of an automobile manufacturing process with textiles makes this series of stainless steel textiles very distinctive.",
