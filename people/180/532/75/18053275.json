    "biography": "Originally founded in 1957 as Brownjohn, Chermayeff and Geismar, the \"Design Studio\" was strongly influenced by European Modern Art currents.  Characterized by a strong sense of form, their work exploits the vitality of repetition and texture. The firm distinguished itself in designs for album covers, graphic designs for books and plays and their inovative installation for the American Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  In 1960, Robert Brownjohn (1925-1970) left the firm.  Chermayeff & Geismar is known for their contribution to the corporate idenity movement with commissions from Chase Manhattan Bank and Mobil Corporation, for whom they designed logos, product design and advertising.",
