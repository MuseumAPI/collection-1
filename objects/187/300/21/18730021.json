    "description":"Trumpeter's banner in red damask, embroidered in gold and silver metal threads with a coat of arms flanked by lion and unicorn, with gold metallic fringe and large tassels.",
    "justification":"This English trumpeter's banner dates to the mid-19th century. The crest, or the coat of arms of Great Britain, is flanked by the Lion and the Unicorn, the symbols of England and Scotland. Additionally, the motto of the Order of the Garter, \u201cHoni soit qui mal y pense,\u201dand the motto of the British monarchs, \u201cDieu et mon droit,\u201d both appear on this piece in elaborate gold and silver couched metal thread embroidery on red silk damask. Finally, the banner is decorated with gold metallic fringe and large tassels. \n&amp;nbsp;\nTrumpeter\u2019s Banner is an excellent example of the type of heraldic textile which became a significant part of royal display and the \u201cdesign\u201d of the monarchy. In its most general definition, heraldry encompasses all matters relating to the duties and responsibilities of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Officer_of_arms\">officers of arms<\/a>, but to most, it is the practice of designing, displaying, and recording <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coat_of_arms\">coats of arms<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heraldic_badge\">badges<\/a>. Because it originated from the need to distinguish participants in combat when their faces were hidden by iron and steel <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Helmet\">helmets<\/a>, the symbols were eventually codified and a system of rules developed. The system of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blazon\">blazoning<\/a> arms includes a description of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Escutcheon_(heraldry)\">escutcheon<\/a> (shield), the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crest_(heraldry)\">crest<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Motto\">mottoes<\/a>, and other insignia.
