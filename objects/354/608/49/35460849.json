    "justification":"This poster was designed in conjunction with the recent exhibition Wim Crouwel: a Graphic Odyssey (2011) at the Design Museum, London.&amp;nbsp; Apeloig, along with six other graphic design studios, was commissioned to produce a poster that employed the grid structure Crouwel devised for his now iconic Stedelijk Museum posters.&amp;nbsp; Drawing on his experience as an intern in the 1980s at Crouwel\u2019s firm Total Design, Apeloig designed a poster that utilizes a simple color palette and the framework of the grid itself to create the text.&amp;nbsp; Both of these signature elements are borrowed from Crouwel\u2019s own graphic design, but for his tribute poster Apeloig uses the grid to create text that appears to glide playfully all over the page, with black text punctuated by white dots emphasizing the diagonal pull of each word against the strict axis of the grid.",
