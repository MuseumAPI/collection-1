    "description": "A one-horse Hansom carriage model, the cabin with one wheel on each side supporting an enclosed seating area, with a window on each side, the roof with a luggage rack and hand hold, all behind a platform accessible by a small step with front guard wall with two curved bars to connect to a horse's harness, and with carriage lamps on the side.",
    "justification": "The two-wheeled&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hansom cab, named after its founder a&amp;nbsp;Mr. A.J. Hansom,&amp;nbsp;had a low center of gravity and was able to turn with a short radius.&amp;nbsp; While an&amp;nbsp;early version had first&amp;nbsp;the driver sitting on top of the carriage roof, another format was to put him at the side, but this made for an unbalanced ride, so the final and most successful version had the seat at the back of the carriage, behind the passengers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Used as a cab for fare-paying customers,&amp;nbsp; this carriage featured levers so that the&amp;nbsp; driver could open and close the door with a lever that he controlled from his seat. Fares were paid at the&amp;nbsp;destination, but, &amp;nbsp;if not paid through the hatch door, then the doors could&amp;nbsp;stay shut.&amp;nbsp;The hatch also provided a way for communication to give instructions and directions .&amp;nbsp; The Hansom cab was considered an adventurous and public&amp;nbsp;vehicle&amp;nbsp;- perhaps a bit &quot;fast&quot;-&amp;nbsp;a bit the way a man's&amp;nbsp;sports car might be, so it was not considered proper for women of the upper classes to ride in them.\nThe speed and dexterity of the cabsform a key part of the story of transportation and&amp;nbsp;were in response to the increased speeds associated with travel after the arrival of the train in the middle of the century. This model accurately portrays the cab where one can see the arrangement of people and driver.",
