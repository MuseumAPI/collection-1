The back is composed of crossed cornucopia, from which spring almost at right angles griffins and heads, holding between them an umbrella shaped canopy, with foliated stem of trumpet flowers, in false chinese taste; the surface is painted in buff, red, green, and blue. The rounded tapering legs curve inwards in the middle but splay out towards the feet; above the feet which are finely tapered, are carved acanthus leaves. At the top the legs have square capitols carved with acanthus leaves and berries.",
