    "biography": "For Naomi Yasuda, manicured nails are like jewelry. With her mesmerizing and intricate nail designs, the Nagoya-born manicurist has turned a cosmetic service into an art form. Yasuda typically uses color as a starting point for her designs, which run from the geometric to the illustrative. She often tops these tiny paintings with beads and ornaments, transforming the nails from flat canvases into sculptural works of art. Working in a wide range of styles, Yasuda believes that nail artists should be flexible enough to delight the imagination of any client. A love for doing nails led Yasuda to Chunichi Beauty College in her hometown after finishing high school. In 2007, she moved to New York City, where she has built a dedicated list of clients, including Alicia Keys and Madonna, as well as collaborations with Barneys New York, CoverGirl, Revlon, and Kenzo.",
