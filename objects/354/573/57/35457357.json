    "description": "Squeeze from Inscription of Foundation Description at Persepolis \n\n\u201cKing Darius proclaims: May Auramazda bring me aid, together with all the gods; and may Auramazda protect this country form the army (of the enemy), from famine, from the lie! May there not come upon this country the army (of the enemy), famine, the lie! This I pray as a favor from Auramazda together with all the gods; this favor may Auramazda grant me together with all the gods.\u201d\n\nSince the late eighteenth century, archaeologists made squeezes as one way to decipher, study and preserve ancient inscriptions carved into large\u2013scale architectural surfaces. Squeezes are formed by pressing wet, moldable paper, pulp, latex, or plaster into a low relief inscription. When the dried material is removed, it provides a three dimensional mirror-image of the original. The squeeze was made under the direction of Ernst Herzfeld likely during his excavations at Persepolis from 1931 to 1935. The original inscription was carved at Persepolis around 515 BCE and is also preserved in an Old Persian, Elamite and a Babylonian version.\n\nIran, Persepolis, Southern Terrace Wall, Paper, ca. 1923-35.
