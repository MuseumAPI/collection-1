    "justification": "\nAngelo Testa (1921-84) was one of the foremost American textile designers during the mid-twentieth century.&amp;nbsp; In 1945 he was the first graduate of the Institute of Design, formerly the New Bauhaus, in Chicago, where he studied under artist, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, and architect, George Fred Keck.&amp;nbsp; Although he ultimately worked primarily in the field of printed textiles, he had a wide reputation as a painter and sculptor.&amp;nbsp; He founded his own company, Angelo Testa &amp; Co., in 1947, which remained active until his death in 1984, and his clients included major companies as Knoll Associates, Herman Miller Furniture Company, and the textile manufacturer, F. Schumacher &amp; Company.&amp;nbsp; \nCampagna, which was more than likely named after Angelo Testa, the designer\u2019s, friend, Paul Campagna, epitomizes Testa\u2019s design vocabulary.&amp;nbsp; The work was designed around 1950 for Knoll Associates, and utilizes Testa\u2019s preferred linear and geometric forms, which were likely associated with his Bauhaus training. The hard edges of the concentric rectangles in this textile, however, have been softened by their appearance of being almost hand-drawn. He made variations of this design, a few of which are also in the Museum\u2019s collection: 1948-119-5, 2002-14-2, 2002 -14-3, and 2001-25-7, and are also titled Campagna. However, the pattern of 1948-119-5 differs slightly as it consists of only six large blocks that have multiple concentric rectangles within each block.&amp;nbsp; \nThis particular textile is one of the most well known works designed by Testa, and was published in many architecture and design journals of the day. It is indicative of his innovative work as one of the leading American textile designers of the 1940s and 1950s, and represents an important moment in post-war America when textiles were a very calculated part of every modern interior.",
