    "description":"Length of digitally printed silk with layered pomegranate-like forms creating an abstract pattern of intersecting circles, in subtle shades of tan and taupe.",
    "justification":"Virtual Fruit (2003) achieves&amp;nbsp;a sense of movement through randomization of pattern over extended lengths, rather than by repetition. The subtle tonal gradation and sense of transparency typical of Ujiie\u2019s work and showcased in this work is only possible with inkjet technology. While it is theoretically possible to print millions of colors with a four-color printing process, Ujiie uses this color precision instead in the creation of layered dimensional effects and subtle color blending",
