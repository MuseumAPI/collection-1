  "description": "The present sepia-colored view of a head of a female turning left and glancing downward occupies the full page from top to bottom and three quarters of the page from left to right, abutting the right edge. The facial features are depicted in heavy outline and shading. The downward glance and closed, full lips produce a pensive, dreamy expression. The hair is a stylized version of Afro-Egyptian braiding.",
