    "description": "Hammered cylindrical vase gently narrowing at the top with a simple decoration of German silver in a Native American pattern, a double band encircling the vase with a dropping design at four points.",
    "justification": "Roycroft began in 1897 with Elbert Hubbard, in East Aurora NY. It was more than a manufactory; it&amp;nbsp;was a&amp;nbsp;way of life devoted to the&amp;nbsp;arts and crafts. For more than 20 years, the Roycroft Campus was a hub of activity with over five hundred working artisans and craftsmen and drew visitors from long distances.&amp;nbsp; The objects produced reflected the hand-crafted look of the arts and crafts movement but aimed to make the objects accessible financially, partly through a choice of materials. This copper vase has&amp;nbsp;an overlay of&amp;nbsp;a silver alloy sometimes known as German silver, co-ordinated with the interiors created there. While copper objects started being produced in 1902,&amp;nbsp;around 1910 Dard Hunter&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Karl Kipp,&amp;nbsp;the two principal designers,&amp;nbsp;collaborated on some Roycroft copper designs, and an&amp;nbsp;early Vienna Secession-influenced&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;style starts to emerge with geometric designs, cut-outs and &quot;German&amp;nbsp;silver&quot; overlays. This vase seems to fall into that category and&amp;nbsp;is therefore likely to be of similar date.\nAn example of a hammered copper jardiniere with German silver trimmings, designed by Karl Kipp, ca. 1910-11, is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.",
