Blanch studied there from 1919-1921 and began teaching at the League\u2019s summer school in Woodstock, New York in 1920. In 1923, he settled in Woodstock and joined the Woodstock artists\u2019 colony.\nDuring the 1930s, as part of the Federal Art Project, he painted murals in post offices in Columbus, Wisconsin; Norwalk, Connecticut; and Fredonia, New York. All three murals are still extant.\nIn 1939, he married his second wife, the artist Doris Lee.
