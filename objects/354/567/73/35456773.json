    "justification": "For the 10th anniversary of Non-Format, the design duo self-published a limited edition set of posters celebrating the work of music icon David Bowie.&amp;nbsp; The project was inspired by a text written by one of Bowie\u2019s famed record producers, Brian Eno.&amp;nbsp; Titled Axis Thinking and published in his 1996 book A Year with Swollen Appendices, Eno argues that by looking at something on a spectrum of two extremes\u2014an axis\u2014one can find undiscovered areas within an already familiar creative endeavor.&amp;nbsp; For Eno, axis thinking was a method that could be used in the music studio, but Non-Format chose to retrospectively examine the musical output of David Bowie.&amp;nbsp; Using their own subject opinion, they categorized each of David Bowie\u2019s albums against arbitrary extremes.&amp;nbsp; The album Scary Monsters, in their estimation, was more Bridge than Tunnel and more Scissors than Rock, and the album Station to Station was more Fight than Flight and more Heart than Head.&amp;nbsp; To illustrate this categorization, Non-Format designed a simple series of mixers and sliders, echoing the equipment that Eno might have used in the recording studio to \u201cdescribe each Bowie album within Non-Format\u2019s own framework of extremes.\u201d &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The result was two posters representing Bowie\u2019s musical albums, the first representing the years 1969-75 and printed in gold on black paper, the second representing the years 1976-84 and printed in silver on black paper.&amp;nbsp; This poster is the later.&amp;nbsp; The work was included in the 2011 Communication Arts Design Annual.\n&amp;nbsp;",
