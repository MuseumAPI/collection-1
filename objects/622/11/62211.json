On top of it are the upper parts of two cornucopias and the blowing head. The outer frame serves as a backdrop for them. It is convex below with three stars. At left are a plant and a plant springing from a fleur-de-lys. Below at left a rough sketch of the decoration with plants laterally, and without cornucopias, and at right the upper part of the inner frame with the bend above cornucopias which lie upon the upper rim.",
