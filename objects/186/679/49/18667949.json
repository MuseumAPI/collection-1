    "gallery_text": "Ren\u00e9 Lalique explored allegorical themes in his jewelry designs, influenced primarily by depictions of the natural world in Japanese design of the period. This design for a corsage ornament depicts an allegory of time. Two female nudes\u2014both personifications of Night\u2014toss diamond stars into an evening sky conveyed by sapphires and diamond stars. This drawing is the only visual record of a lost fantastical jewel that was first presented at the 1900 l\u2019Exposition Universelle in Paris. Displayed beneath a decorative canopy of stars and bats, the jewel cemented Lalique\u2019s reputation as a preeminent designer of jewelry in the Art Nouveau style. His designs frequently incorporated flowers, insects, animals and nude forms using sumptuous materials, including gold, silver, diamonds, and pearls. But, like his contemporary Faberg\u00e9, he also helped popularize humble gemstones and materials such as enamel, jasper, ivory, coral, and glass. Actress Sarah Bernhardt was among the most famous wearers of Lalique\u2019s highly-coveted jewelry.",
