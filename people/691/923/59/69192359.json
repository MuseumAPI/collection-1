Trained as a goldsmith in Pforzheim and Hamburg, Germany, Fleischhut expanded her vision as an artist and designer at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy and the Sandberg Institute, both in the Netherlands, where she developed a designer\u2019s eye for complex materiality, a sculptor\u2019s sense of scale, and an alchemist\u2019s drive to explore the universe by unlocking the secrets of the earth.",
