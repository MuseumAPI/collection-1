  "description": "The profile is depicted in a moderately heavy line. The straight vertical line of the forehead changes to the slightly bumpy contour of the sharp-tipped nose. The eye socket and sharply upward-slanting eyebrow, intersecting the hairline, are heavily shaded. Shading also emphasizes the cheekbone, as well as the line drawn from the chin to ear-level. Curly hair framing the face loosens into wavy lines covering the back of the head. A scrolling pattern appears next to the profile outline. A curve to the left of the neck indicates the shoulder, and a continuing curlicue to the right of the shoulder line suggests a necklace or garment neckline.",
