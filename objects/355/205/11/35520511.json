    "description": "The Hawaiians claim that the stone and the cowrey must have a certain color resemblance to each other in order to attract the squid. Lead is now at times used instead of stone. This is let down into the water and dangled close to the squid, or octopus rather, who is attracted by it and wraps himself about it. This method is still very successfully  practiced by Hawaiian and by Chinese fisherman. It shows no signs of going out of date.",
