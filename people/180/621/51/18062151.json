    "biography": "Architect Antoine Predock was born in 1936 in Lebanon, Missouri.  While studying at the School of Architecture at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, he became entranced with the landscape of the American southwest.  As he has written, \u201cNew Mexico has formed my experience in an all-pervasive sense. I don't think of New Mexico as a region. I think of it as a force that has entered my system, a force that is composed of many things \u2026 Lessons learned in the American Southwest apply anywhere in the world - my \"regionalism\" is portable.\u201d\n\nPredock founded Antoine Predock Architect in 1967. The firm is based in Albuquerque, but maintains studios in Los Angeles and Taiwan. Predock designs expansive spaces that seamlessly weave the present with the past. He has been recognized for his unique ability to design highly contextual works that respond to their environment.  Some of his major projects have included the San Diego Padres Ballpark; Austin City Hall in Texas; Tacoma Art Museum in Tacoma, Wash.; Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg; the Las Vegas Central Library and Discovery Museum; the Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, Fla.; the Nelson Fine Arts Center at Arizona State University in Tempe; the National Palace Museum in Taiwan; and buildings for Stanford University (California) and Rice University (Texas).  Predock was the 2007 recipient of the National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement.",
