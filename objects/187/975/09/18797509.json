    "justification":"\nIn 2006, Stefan Hemmerle traveled with his wife Sylveli, his son Christian, and his daughter-in-law Yasmin to Egypt, where Yasmin was born.&amp;nbsp; The family\u2019s experience of the country proved deeply inspiring to them all.&amp;nbsp; A private tour of the Cairo Museum, where Stefan was able to intimately view ancient artifacts, was a creative revelation.&amp;nbsp; The seductive simplicity of line that transcended thousands of years and the amuletic power of Egyptian jewels formed the basis for a series of new designs, including the Egyptian Story Harmony Bangle Bracelet that has been offered to the Museum.&amp;nbsp; This drawing, executed by Hemmerle staff, provides a stunning illustration with graphite and crayon of the striations echoed throughout the Bangle.",
