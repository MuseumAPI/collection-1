  "description": "Interior view of a small room decorated in the Neo-Gothic style. At left a folding screen ornamented with quatrefoils and colored panels partially obscures a portrait of a woman in a heavy gilt frame. At right a similar screen is positioned near a small day bed above which a circular portrait in a gothic-style frame hangs. A desk, chair and ornamental wastebasket occupy the center of the room, just in front of a large window ornamented with stained glass panels of green and yellow and a small replica of a painting of the Assumption of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
