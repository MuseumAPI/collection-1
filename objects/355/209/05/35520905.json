    "justification":"TextielLab at the Textiel Museum in Tilburg, The Netherlands, is a studio for experimentation with state of the art knitting and weaving technologies. The lab regularly invites designers working in a variety of disciplines to conduct research using these machines, and&amp;nbsp;to explore new capabilities. \nIn 2012, Raw Color was invited to participate. The young designers Daniera ter Haar and Christoph Brach work primarily in graphic design and photography, and had already initiated a series of experiments with color, including using vegetables to create printing inks, and&amp;nbsp;examining the relationship between&amp;nbsp;materiality and color. Working with the team at Tilburg, they created a series of tea towels and blankets exploring concepts from graphic design in woven form. &amp;nbsp;\nIn terms of both technology and terminology there is surprisingly little overlap between print and weaving. The Index Collection uses a series of boxes similar to the screen keys seen on the sides of printed fabrics, to express the intensity of color in each surface, from 10% to 100%. In the case of weaving, this variation in color intensity is created by altering the weave structure to bring more of the colored yarn to the surface. In addition to color intensity, each also shows a duotone and multitone example of color blending as executed in weaving. ",
