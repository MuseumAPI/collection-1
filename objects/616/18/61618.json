The retable is a kind of pavilion, with two columns supporting on either side the circular part of the entablature, and two of its short, straight, lateral parts. All the columns stand closely near each other. Inside is a group of the Ascension of the Virgin. Above the central part is a dome with a medallion, supported by two sitting angels at the front, and a female statue with a cross on top. Above the lateral parts are two statues. The socle has two rows of panels. The upper ones are decorated with festoons, the lower ones are undecorated. In front of the central one are respectively the mensa and the tabernacle. Laterally are two angular projecting pedestals with statues. Eschutcheons are in their front panels. Usual background.",
