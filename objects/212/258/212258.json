One pyramid shape, viewed from above, appears to project into the room.  A floor lamp composed of tall triangular panels stands in front of painted wall.  On the wall to right of decorated wall is small, box-shaped relief with yellow ground.  A black irregular \"blob,\" to left of lamp may represent a table.",
