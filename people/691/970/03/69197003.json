    "biography": "Lauren Bowker (British, b. 1985) founded TheUnseen as a creative house to explore the application of biological and chemical technology to wearable materials. Bowker studied chemistry and textiles at the Manchester School of Art and received a master\u2019s in printed textiles from the Royal College of Art, where she developed color-changing inks that respond to environmental conditions. Applying these inks and compounds to fashion enables wearers, and those around them, to visualize otherwise invisible phenomena. The AIR collection (2014), for example, includes wind-reactive ink\u2014which changes color based on movement and turbulence in the air around it\u2014applied to a finned leather jacket. The technology could enable communication with those who are unable to do so by any other means.",
