    "description": "Two pilasters standing upon a dado support an entablature, for the moldings of which ornamentation is alternatively suggested, at left. Alternative suggestions are also made for the capitals and for design and colorings of details of the pilasters. Circular medallion portraits framed by squares, upon and beneath which palmettes are shown, decorate the centers of the pilasters. A lilac panel is bordered by an entablature, for the decoration of which alternative suggestions were made. Alternative suggestions were also made for the palmette frieze hanging beneath the entablature. Upon it stands a base with semicircular frame between, containing griffons. Two women and two putti are represented in the lunette.",
