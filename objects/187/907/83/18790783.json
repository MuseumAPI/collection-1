    "description": "Pattern simulates a bead-board paneled wall, composed of found wood planks layed end to end, painted in varying shades of off-white, complete with nail holes, abrasions, and other scars.",
    "justification": "These patterns copy the surfaces the designer creates on his handmade furniture made of found wood. Scrapwood Wallpaper is digitally printed and perfectly captures the grain and texture of the found wood surfaces. It is nearly impossible to distinguish this printing from actual wood. \nThese designs are a unique take on faux bois papers, which historically have copied rare and exotic woods. The antique papers were also frequently embellished with simulated gilt bronze mounts, or elaborately carved or decorated. Twentieth-century examples began copying more familiar woods such as oak, walnut and pine. These were usually produced as a cheaper alternative to the actual wood. Scrapwood reproduces discarded scraps of wood, complete with nail holes, paint, scrapes and other visible signs of use and abuse. There is nothing fancy or pretentious about the selection or arrangement of these wood pieces, but there is a beauty in the honesty of the scarred wood panels; a soothing quality to the obvious imperfections and repetition. \nThis effect coincides with the designer\u2019s desire to show that objects created with obvious imperfections could be both attractive and functional. He did this by reversing modern production methods: he began by using discarded, abundant materials, with simple production methods, and invested as much labor as possible into the creative process to make unique pieces of furniture.\nNo VOC\u2019s are used in the production of this wallpaper and the amount of waste produced in the manufacturing process has been reduced by more than 50% over the past few years.",
