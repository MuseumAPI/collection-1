With a wide frame of interlacing foliated scrolls within pearl guard borders, in which pearl centers (due to demands of technique) are rendered tiny crosses. Very incomplete portions of interspaced ornament showing peacock tails. Red and green on a cream ground, with small amounts of gold metallic (cream silk wound with gilded goldbeaters' skin) on faces of sphinxes and small lions. Mounted on board with design painted in with gouache.",
