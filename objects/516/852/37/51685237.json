    "justification": "This set of three lithographed panels was one of Alphonse Maria Mucha\u2019s designs for Lef\u00e8vre-Utile biscuit packaging.&amp;nbsp; Mucha had a long relationship with Lef\u00e8vre-Utile, a French biscuit company founded in Nantes in 1846.&amp;nbsp; Beginning in the 1880s, Lef\u00e8vre-Utile commissioned well-known artists to design their packaging and advertising.&amp;nbsp; In 1896, Mucha was commissioned to create posters for the company.&amp;nbsp; He was the first designer to use the company\u2019s initials, LU, as a decorative motif, which he did in his design for the company\u2019s 1897 calendar.&amp;nbsp; The abbreviation proved so popular that the company subsequently formally took up the moniker.&amp;nbsp; Around the turn of the century, Mucha was tasked with designing LU\u2019s packaging designs and a brand identity.&amp;nbsp; Mucha\u2019s designs reflect a particular sensitivity to the shape of the packaging and the pleasant natures of its contents\u2014Mucha\u2019s signature languorous women, along with the use of a consistent font and logo, reinforced LU\u2019s brand identity and transformed the package into its own publicity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;",
