  "description": "A full head of long, wavy hair frames the left side of the face, covering the ear, but exposing a dangling earring, before falling behind the neck and shoulder. On the right, the hair hangs down, framing the profile outline and then falling behind the shoulder. Under a straight brow, the eyeball is just visible at the inner corner of the eyelid. The full lips are parted; the upper one curves downward.  A choker comprised of abstract curved forms encircles the long neck, and the gently ruffled low neckline emphasizes the bare, curved shoulders.",
