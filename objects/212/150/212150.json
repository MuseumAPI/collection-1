  "description": "Poster design is a montage of reproductions of polaroid color portraits arranged in a grid, set at an angle at upper right quadrant of the sheet, balanced by a large calander for the month of July at the bottm. Smaller calanders for May and June, printed only in line and numbers, seem to float on the design. At upper left, a diagonal section of black dots on white reference the designer's tonal Ben-Day sheets. The lower section is speckled with blue, red and yellow, and letters, numbers, lines and text hover, creating a three dimensional depth.",
