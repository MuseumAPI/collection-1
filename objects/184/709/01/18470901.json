Fine gold granulation work throughout.\n\nThe design of this brooch, like some other pieces made by the Castellanis, is based closely on jewelery unearthed at an important archeological site at Kol Oba in Southern Russia, discovered in 1830.  Drawings of the jewels, which date from the 4th century BCE, were published after their transferal to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.",
