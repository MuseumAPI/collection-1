  "description": "The page is divided in thirds and features an image, centered, in each third, and a line of small upper and lower case type separating the upper and middle thirds and middle and lower thirds. The three images comprise a pictograph of the client's last name, Carbonell: car, bone and [the letters] ll. The car, in gray tones, is viewed from the side, its front end facing left and the white background of the page visible through its windows. A diagonally placed illustration of the bone in outline includes curved marks next to the bone ends representing movement. The two adjacent ll's, separated, are in bold italics. The lines of type refer to the store names and city locations showing the designer's products.",
