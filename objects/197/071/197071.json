  "description": "The design features a heart and circle, superimposed on a shield-shaped field, vertically striped. The whole is enclosed within a heart shape, formed by a chain in the upper half and a branch-and-leaf design in the bottom half. The initials LB, with the L in reverse formation, are imprinted at the intersection of the branches. Just above the logo is a crown-shaped pictograph and above that is a curved strip, within which is the date of the Love Ball. Love Ball, in mixed upper and lower base, appears all across the lower part of the page.",
