    "justification": "Justification text from acquisition file:\nAmazon Kindle I and II\nThe Amazon Kindle is a milestone product, whose design both physical and technological is leading to fundamental change in book publishing, book design, and reading habits.\nIn development by Amazon since 2004, the Amazon Kindle is a hardware and software platform for reading electronic books. The Kindle I debuted in the fall of 2007, followed by the Kindle II, introduced in February, 2009. Unlike earlier e-reader devices which required connecting to a computer to download book files, the Kindle employs wireless connection.&amp;nbsp; One can simply download books directly from the internet into the Kindle. Currently, 285,000 titles are ready for purchase and instant download from Amazon.com's virtual book store. The Kindle I holds approximately 200 books in its memory; hundreds more on a memory card. \nAnother feature of the Kindle is that one can subscribe to magazines and newspapers via the Amazon on-line store, accessing them with the keyboard just below the screen. These virtual publications are sent automatically to the subscriber's Kindle.\nThe white housing features a large screen and was designed with a quality that Amazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, describes as &quot;bookishness&quot;: it has the dimensions of a paperback book, and the width tapers to suggest the bulge toward a book's binding.&amp;nbsp; Both the Kindle I and II weigh about 10 ounces, so are easy to hold. Unlike a computer they do not run hot or make intrusive beeps. The small keyboard is part of the all-in-one unit, located below the screen, making it easily accessible, with small, closely spaced keys suitable for thumb-typing.\nReadability:&amp;nbsp; E-ink technology was developed at the MIT Media Lab in about 2004. A little like an Etch-A-Sketch, it forms letters by rearranging chemicals under the surface of the screen, appearing much more like a printed page than pixilated font on a computer screen. The Kindle also allows the user to change the font size.",
