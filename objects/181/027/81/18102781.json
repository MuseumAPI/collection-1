The vignettes show: upper left, Juno seated in a chariot drawn over the clouds by peacocks accompanied by amoretti (personifying \"Air\"); lower left, Vulcan forging armor (personifying \"Fire\"); upper right, Saturn seated in a landscape holding a cornucopia and beside him a globe, quartered with four animals (personifying \"Earth\"); lower right, Venus borne over the water on a shell drawn by dolphins, attended by amoretti (personifying \"Water\").\n\nScale, in pen and black ink (according to Richard Wunder, by the artist's hand), lower margin.",
