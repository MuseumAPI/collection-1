    "description": "The folding top inlaid in contrasting colors of wood with floral and foliage decoration. Carved legs supporting a flat work surface and a backboard, both decorated with inlaid soft-wood marquetry of flowers, the backboard including two small fold-down shelves to support inkwell, pens, etc.",
    "justification": "This piece represents the art of marquetry used in an&amp;nbsp;Art Nouveau aesthetic combined with a practical design for a writing desk that can be both moved and stored. The entire piece was designed to fold flat against the wall when not in use: the x-form legs collapse and the desk top slides up so the plain underside faces out.&amp;nbsp; The desk, when open, also has two drop-down ledges to hold candles for light or even an inkwell.&amp;nbsp;The trailing vine and flowers resemble the designs that Gall\u00e9 used in his glass designs.&amp;nbsp; A good example of an old technique combined with modern usage that was a result of the strong technical training. Additionally, the studying of design sources&amp;nbsp; that could be applied across media produced a cohesive design thinking that related the designs of furniture and other decorative arts at the turn of the twentieth century.
