  "description": "Project for the sculptured decorations of three caulted ceiling strips.  The lower half.  The strip at left: the frame is supported by a flying child partly in front of the lower panel.  It is decorated similar to the corresponding central one, shown in -2509.  Below is a broken pediment with two children, standing and leaning upon the corners.  The central strip: a flying putto supports the frame.  He is in front of the lower panel which is decorated with acanthus blossoms.  Below is an attic pediment, with a mask with a shell as a diadem and with cornucopias springing from the mouth.  Below is a festoon. Strip at right:  the lower panel is decorated similarly to the central one, shown in -2509.  Below is a pediment with two sitting children.  Crosses are in the free spaces, corresponding to those in -2509.  The scale is at right, in the lower framing line.  On the reverse is the other half of the project of -2509.  Entwined palm branches are sketched as a decoration of framing strips at left.",
