    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Franz von Z\u00fclow was a designer and painter whose oeuvre included not only printing design but designs for wallpaper and fabrics, decorated household objects, painted furniture and tapestries, in addition to paintings, drawings, picture books and other graphic works.&amp;nbsp; After studying at two drawing schools, the Allgemeine Zeichenschule (General Drawing School) and the Graphische Lehr-und Versuchsanstalt (the Graphic Academy and Research Institute) in Vienna from 1901-1903, he went on to broaden his studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts, or Arts and Crafts) until 1906. In 1905, he decorated a screen designed by Josef Hoffmann with colored woodcuts of sunflowers, a design he adapted for a fabric pattern. He joined the Vienna Secession in 1908, and exhibited at the International Art Exhibition in Rome in 1911. In 1912 he was the recipient of the Prince of Liechtenstein\u2019s travel stipend, when he went to, Germany, France and England. &amp;nbsp;That year he designed rugs and textiles for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte as well as decorative panel paintings, and stencil designs. By 1920\/21 he was an instructor at the ceramics study workshop in Gmunden.&amp;nbsp; In 1925 he won Gold Medals at the Paris &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Moderne with a vase made at the Wiener Porzellan Manufaktur at Augarten (see Neuwirth, Wiener Porzellan Sp\u00e4tbarock-Art Deco, Vienna 1990, p. 114). The decoration on the case is extremely similar to that on the pieces here. He exhibited ceramics at numerous other exhibitions in Vienna up through the 1930\u2019s.\nZ\u00fclow experiments with printing techniques led him, in 1907, &amp;nbsp;to patent a method using a cut paper pattern to create a template that is colored and printed in reverse.&amp;nbsp; In contrast to previous template printing, the resulting picture is not dependent on the negative forms that have been cut out but on the remaining crosspieces.&amp;nbsp; These form a network of black outlines and the empty spaces between are often strongly colored, creating an almost cloisonn\u00e9-like effect.&amp;nbsp; This use of flat areas of color with black outlines is visible in the decoration of this group. This stylistic effect, combined with an the influence&amp;nbsp; of folk art resulted in na\u00efve style ornamentation and preferences for fantasy and fairy tale scenes, depicted with broad areas of bright color, both very visible in the pieces in this group.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It appears that the forms are ones the factory also used for other patterns, but the decoration is all Z\u00fclow\u2019s, giving us insight into the importance of porcelain painting in determining the aesthetic of the era.&quot;&amp;nbsp;",
