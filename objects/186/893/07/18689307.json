    "justification": "Ingrain paper was patented in the United States in 1877. In this process, the paper is dyed in the pulp stage rather than printing the color on the surface. This roll of paper, found in London, is printed on an unusual rich red ground which makes it an interesting addition to the collection. The chintz-style design was one of hundreds of designs based on textile patterns that were produced in the late 19th century.",
