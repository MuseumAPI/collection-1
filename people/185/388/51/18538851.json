    "biography": "Founded in 1993, Architecture Research Office (ARO), whose principals are Stephen Cassell, Adam Yarinsky and Kim Yao, is an architectural firm based in New York..  Utilizing research and analysis to drive design, ARO works with a diverse array of clients to design architecture that unites the conceptual and the pragmatic with a strong, coherent vision. Their practice includes architecture, urban design, and strategic planning.  Important  projects have included the Donald Judd Home + Studio Museum in New York City; a Tulane University dormitory; an efficient, affordable housing prototype,R-House, in Syracuse, NY,  Princeton University\u2019s School of Architecture Addition; and the Prada New York Epicenter Store, which was co-designed with Rem Koolhaas\/OMA.  ARO continues to work on projects that extend the boundaries of architecture beyond building, including proposals such as New Urban Ground, presented at MoMA\u2019s Rising Currents exhibition in 2011, and Five Principles for Greenwich South, created in partnership with the Alliance for Downtown New York in 2009.  Architecture Research Office was the recipient of the 2011 Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for Architecture.",
