    "description":"Three fragments of large-scale design of tangent roundels containing symmetrical design of addorsed lions twisting heads around to bite backs of confronted bird-women standing on lions' backs. Twining snakes at back of each bird-woman's neck. Wide borders showing repeats of a man's figure between two griffons (apotheosis of Alexander?), and pearled guard bands. Smaller roundel overlaid at four tangent points of large roundels, with central rosette and inscription border. Interspaces completely filled with large four-pointed rosettes composed of four ornamental tree forms, each with roundel enclosing rabbit-like creature on either side of trunk, growing out of eight-pointed star. Blue-green, dark rose, golden tan, metal brocading now tarnished to dull brown, on cream ground",
