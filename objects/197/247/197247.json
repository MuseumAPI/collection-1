  "description": "Recto: A wide horizontal band is at top, showing Earle Mankey imprinted in capital letters, with Mankey larger than Earle. Directly beneath Earle is  a design in black outline of three intersecting ovals, a centered ball, and six scattered smaller balls. An image of two men and chemical laboratory equipment occupies the remaining space; one man is writing  in a laboratory notebook while the other looks on. Verso: Earle Mankey is imprinted in black in small capital letters on a horizontal grey band at top. The song titles are listed underneath each other from top to bottom on the left. A larger version of the oval-and-balls design is repeated on the right in the upper half and music and design production details appear\r\nunderneath it.",
