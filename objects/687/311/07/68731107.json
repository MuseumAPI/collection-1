    "justification": "In 2010, Experimental Jetset was asked to redesign a poster campaign that they had originally designed in 1996 for rock concert venue Paradiso. Paradiso has played a significant role in the Dutch rock- and counter-culture since its opening in 1968. \nExperimental Jetset\u2019s 1996 design for a tri-weekly poster series had used a series of capsule-shaped holes to reveal the surfaces on which they were hung. For their updated design, the designers transformed the capsule-shaped holes into circular ones, which were die-cut to overlap or eclipse the printed circles beside them, reminiscent of the popular calendar posters showing the different phases of the moon. The design team appreciated this lunar parallel for its relationship to the nocturnal schedule of the concert venue. They streamlined some of the poster\u2019s elements, eliminating the arrows surrounding the venue\u2019s name, but they incorporated a second color into the final design.",
