  "description": "In this plainly decorated salon, a marble (or marbleized) dado is topped by a floral border which runs around the painted pale green walls. The frieze around the ceiling, done either in plaster or trompe l'oeil, echoes the swags of the simple white curtains. A crystal chandelier in Neo-Classic style hangs over a marble-topped round table. An enfilade of rooms is seen through the open door of the salon just off-center on the right. On the walls are engravings after contemporary paintings, including Death of a Christian Martyr by Paul Delaroche.",
