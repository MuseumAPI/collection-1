    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Notable Italian architect\/designer Gaetano Pesce has been designing furniture and other objects since the 1960s. A number of his works are considered icons of twentieth-century design, and he is particularly noted for his experimental forms in resin and other synthetics that emphasize the creative process in fabricating functional forms in modern materials. \nThis &quot;Moss&quot; lamp exemplifies Pesce's approach to &quot;industrialized non-conformity,&quot; production using&amp;nbsp; modern fabrication techniques associated with mass-production, comibined with contemporary materials, to produce unique objects. Here the supple silicone is poured and trailed to achieve a basic sphere, but it is not a perfect form. The end result is dictated by the behavior of the material. The form encloses a single incandescent light source that casts a soft glow through the interstices and varied thicknesses of the translucent thread-like trailings of the silicone body. The textured surface also invites the user to touch, its surprisingly warm, soft, and malleable form evoking an emotional response.\nThis was a prototype. Whether ultimately unique or made as a limited production, the lamp appears as an image in &quot;1999&quot; on the designer's website timeline.&quot;",
