    "description": "Drawing of gold, emerald, and sapphire bangle with four images below of stones in plan and perspective.  Bangle was first produced in 1994 on commission with modifications.  The bangle was then produced out of two materials, half in white gold and half in yellow gold.",
    "justification": "In the late 1980s, Stefan Hemmerle created the first designs for the Harmony Bangle, a bracelet that has since become the signature of the Hemmerle firm. In the Harmony Bangle, the open-ended form, a style of bracelet that can be traced back to ancient times, is distinctly modern. Each end of the bracelet is capped in gems or stones while the rounded forms serve to extend the fluid lines of the bracelet. A hidden closure mechanism embedded within the bracelet enables the seamless form. The Harmony Bangle\u2019s simple, sophisticated silhouette has become the basis of decades of imaginative and seductive contrasts of materials. \nHemmerle\u2019s original conception of the Harmony Bangle featured exquisite gems set within the finest base materials. This concept drawing for a Harmony Bangle, executed by a member of the firm\u2019s staff after a design by Hemmerle, illustrates a bracelet of gold set with jewels of exceptional quality\u2014an emerald on one end and a sapphire on the other. The careful rendering emphasizes the rounded forms of the jewels by illustrating them both in profile and from above, and directs attention to the harmonious contrast of brilliant colors. A drawing of the bracelet at an angle emphasizes the circular fluidity that characterizes the Harmony Bangle.\nThis drawing is one of four Hemmerle drawings under consideration for acquisition. Together, the group would enhance the museum\u2019s collection of jewelry design drawings.",
