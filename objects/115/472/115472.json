  "description": "The present object, which in its original form would have been wrapped around the product, has been flattened. The product name, Curado, is imprinted in a hand-lettered and vertically styled script, imprinted in white on a navy blue background. Further product information, as well as a horizontal, wavy-lined border at the top and bottom edges, are imprinted in pale pink. Wherever the letter \"R\" appears among the serif-styled capitals featured in the copy framing Curado, it curves out and downward, extending in a distinctive fashion below the line of type .",
