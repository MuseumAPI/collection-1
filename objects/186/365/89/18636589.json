This \u201cTen-Deck House\u201d drawing is an original sketch exemplifying one of Fuller\u2019s earlier ideas for a mass-produced, light-weight housing project. It represents ten geometrically shaped floors incorporated into an aluminum structure, supported by a central mast and cables. Fuller intended for the entire structure to be air-lifted by zeppelin and placed in situ by exploding a crater, which the mast would fit into. The ten decks would comprise four floors of living space, with a separate floor for servants, a nursery, library, pool, gym and finally a sky promenade. The multi-functional nature of such a building would also liberate space on the ground for cars and other vehicles. Unfortunately for Fuller this project was never realized.",

His lightweight aluminum structure was intended to be airlifted by zeppelin and lowered into a crater. Fuller produced low-cost multiples of his drawing using a mimeograph and hand-colored the prints.",
