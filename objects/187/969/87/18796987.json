    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Best known for his deconstructivist buildings, Canadian-American architect and Pritzker-Prize winner Frank O. Gehry (1929- ) experimented with furniture design in the late 1960s before he became a household name.&amp;nbsp; He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers.&amp;nbsp; In addition, before becoming involved with architecture, Gehry designed museum exhibitions, which allowed him to understand how three-dimensional objects inhabited a space.&amp;nbsp; With the oil crisis of the 1970s and the growing awareness of the environmental effects of consumer waste, plastic lost some of its appeal, causing some designers to opt for more eco-friendly materials.&amp;nbsp; Gehry\u2019s medium of choice for his furniture designs was the industrial material cardboard; in particular, he employed the thick, sturdy kind that was used inside hollow-core doors.&amp;nbsp; His first furniture series, \u201cEasy Edges,\u201d was produced from 1969 to 1973, and consisted of inexpensive, mass-produced chairs and side tables in rectilinear shapes that were sold in department stores, including Bloomingdale\u2019s.&amp;nbsp; This furniture line, considered the Volkswagen of furniture, was intended to suit the needs of the young and old alike, as well as urban sophisticates and country dwellers.&amp;nbsp; \nHowever, his second series, \u201cExperimental Edges,\u201d produced from 1979 to 1982, took a more modernist approach.&amp;nbsp; Employing primarily curving lines, these highly structural pieces were handmade and sold through galleries as limited-edition art furniture, targeting a particular wealthy, high-end consumer.&amp;nbsp; The c. 1988 \u201cBubbles\u201d chaise longue embodies all of these features.&amp;nbsp; It is number 7 from an edition of 50, as noted in a plaque on the underside of the piece, and is constructed of corrugated cardboard with fire-retardant coating.&amp;nbsp; Its curved arabesque form is dedicated by the light-weight cardboard.&amp;nbsp; The cardboard base has been folded into s-curves, simulating a giant, continuous ribbon, over which is laid a rough-hewn layered cardboard cushion. In this manner, Gehry has taken a disposable material and turned it into a highly sculptural piece of art furniture, imbuing a seemingly worthless material with value.&amp;nbsp; It\u2019s a contemporary version of modern furniture innovations made of bent wood, bent tubular steel, and molded plastic. This chaise longue predates Gehry\u2019s well-known monumental architectural structures, foreshadowing on a smaller scale and in a less extravagant material the sweeping, curving lines that have come to represent Gehry\u2019s work, most notably the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.&amp;nbsp; Gehry introduced a third furniture series in 1992, entitled \u201cBentwood Furniture,\u201d with each piece named after a different ice hockey term (and it is still in production today).&quot;",
