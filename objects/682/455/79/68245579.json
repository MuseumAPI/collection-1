    "justification": "Some of Horner's brooch designs also might have doubled as hatpin ornaments, of which the firm made a large number. This design-on a bar brooch-appears to be the kind of design that could have been used for either form. Stylistically looking like&amp;nbsp;Liberty-simplified Cymric, they had a greater breadth of style.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\nNo design authorship is claimed anywhere on drawings or in catalogues for any of the designs the firm produced. However, the most art nouveau pieces were produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most art nouveau style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. \nLike other pieces, this brooch would have been&amp;nbsp;mass-produced, using silver wire formed into swirls and the bar, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand and most was made in the basse-taille \u2013or shallow-cut- technique.&amp;nbsp; This technique involves cutting through engraving or chasing silver with bas-relief patterns and covering that in translucent enamel. Rich tonal qualities are achieved by varying the amounts of engraving and depth of enamel. \nThese brooches would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.\n&amp;nbsp;",
