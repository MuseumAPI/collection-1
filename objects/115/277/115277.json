  "description": "A high forehead; long nose, upturned at the pointed tip; full lips; and rounded chin, segueing into a sharp diagonal line depicting the neck, comprise the outline of the present profile. The straight line of the eyebrow slants upward over a wide open eye. A fringe of rosette-like forms frames the face from the top of the head to the chin line. Faint lines toward the back of the head may indicate a headdress. A long, broken-curved line, suggesting an exaggerated shoulder line,  juts out to the right from the neck.",
