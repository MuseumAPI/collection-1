    "title": "Excavating Design: 18th-century Drawings and Prints from the Permanent Collection",
    "text": "The exhibition showcases a selection of works from the museum\u2019s extensive collection of 18th century European drawings and prints, featuring fantastical, unrealized architectural designs inspired by the artifacts of ancient Rome. Prompted by reports of archaeological findings, 18th century artists and writers traveled to Rome to see the excavated monuments, sculptures, and relics of the past and capture their majesty on paper. The works evoke 18th century Europe\u2019s obsession with the grandeur of Rome and create a visual resource that can be appreciated both for its beauty and its relevance for scholars and designers today.",
