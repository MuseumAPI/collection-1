Embedded columns are supporting the oblong entablature, framing the view into the sky, there a female genius and two putti, supporting together one flower stem, are visible.  In the middle of the short sides are views into vaulted rooms, with three putti, singing or playing instruments are sitting in the foreground.  In the middle of the long sides are clouds, making also invisible the entablature with groups with the same occupation.  On each side are two niches between the columns, each containing a statue.  On the reverse a caption in handwriting of the 17th century: \"Canagliore caesore Serme dipinto / ne la congregatione di gentilomi / Diputato razere meniconi\". And in a somewhat antique handwriting: \"Roma Roma\".",
