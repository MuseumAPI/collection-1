She went to the School of Art and Architecture at Yale where she trained under Josef Albers, eventually becoming a painting major and one of Albers\u2019s top students. While at Yale she became enamored with Pre-Columbian art and textiles and began a research project that led her to Mexico where she learned to weave from local weavers. She would eventually live and work in many other countries such as Chile, Peru, India, Thailand, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, France, and the United States.",
