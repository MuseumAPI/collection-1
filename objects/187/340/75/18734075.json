On upper right, yellow anthropomorphic form \"holds,\" almost like Atlas, a black circle, cut off by top of page. Inside yellow form, thin black lines echo arms, trunk, and legs of form. In center, a form with six curved points outlined in gray covers a cloud-like cluster of curved pen marks. Below is five-pointed, slightly animalistic black form, intersected by several thin white lines.",
