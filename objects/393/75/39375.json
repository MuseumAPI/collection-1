  "description": "The gate set in a rusticated wall.  The gate itself consists of two wings with two vertically oriented panels making up each wing.  Centered in the upper panels are circular medallions with the royal chiffre (initials), surrounded by two laurel branches.  In the lunette is an entablature with the inscription \"HOTEL DES MONNOIES.\"  Above entablature is the winged royal coat of arms between two cornucopias and flanked below by laurel twigs.  \r\nThe alternate drawing for the lunette is attached at the top to main sheet on a separate piece of paper.  The alternative suggestion shows an enriched variation of the design of the lunette.  An entablature in the shape of a pediment is supported by the points of the cornucopia.  The crown lies upon the pediment with the heads of two maces.  The coat of arms is framed by an oval band with the chain of the Order of the Holy Spirit hanging from the entablature and the badge being in front of the crossing point of the laurel branches, leaves of which help to support the oval band.",
