    "justification": "In 1953, Erik Nitsche began working for the newly formed General Dynamics, a parent corporation that oversaw eleven different manufacturers producing cutting edge technology in areas such as hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and nuclear physics for United States defense. &amp;nbsp;They designed work as varied as the B-58 supersonic jet bomber to atomic powered submarines.&amp;nbsp; \nAs design critic Steven Heller has noted, Nitsche arrived at General Dynamics at a unique moment.&amp;nbsp; At the beginning of the Cold War, fear drove the national push for nuclear deterrence.&amp;nbsp; But there was also a pervasive mindset that nuclear power held the potential for world peace.&amp;nbsp; John Jay Hopkins, General Dynamics\u2019 president, was adamant that the public perception of the corporation was one that saw their scientific research and technological progress as arbiters of peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.&amp;nbsp; Nitsche was tasked with exporting this mission through visual means.&amp;nbsp; \nBy 1955, Nitsche became a full-time consultant to General Dynamics, and his first project was to design the company\u2019s exhibitionfor the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, held in Geneva, Switzerland.&amp;nbsp; Co-exhibitors included other major American corporations including General Electric and Westinghouse.&amp;nbsp; Hopkins wanted Nitsche\u2019s installation to lift General Dynamics reputation to those of their fellow exhibitors.&amp;nbsp; As the manufacturers of the first atomic submarine, the Nautilus, and with a commission to build the first atomic airplane, General Dynamics was far ahead of many of these competitors.&amp;nbsp; But with such top-secret projects, the company had almost no material that they could share with the general public.&amp;nbsp; Thus Nitsche was forced to find a way to use symbolism to express the company\u2019s mission, rather than evoke their specific projects.&amp;nbsp; The result was a graphic presentation on peaceful uses of the atom, \u201cAtoms for Peace.\u201d\nNitsche suspected that his European audience would be drawn to posters.&amp;nbsp; He created six designs that were printed in six languages, representing different fields of General Dynamics research.&amp;nbsp; Melding influences from modernist fine art and scientific imagery, Nitsche created posters that boldly suggested the exciting possibilities of the future.&amp;nbsp; \nThe initial poster designs were so successful that the designer &amp;nbsp;went on to produce several more sets in the series, as well as General Dynamics identity campaign and corporate advertising for the next nine years, until Hopkins\u2019 death in 1964.&amp;nbsp; The designs have become icons of 1950s graphic design, synonymous with a vision for an idealistic future in the atomic age.&amp;nbsp; ",
