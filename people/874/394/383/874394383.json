    "biography": "Petra Zimermann was born in Graz, Austria in 1975. She attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Brataslava between 1996 and 1998, studying jewelry and metal working. Continuing her studies, she enrolled in the Master Class for Sculpture at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna in 1997, graduating in 2000. Ms Zimmerman lives and works in Vienna. She has adopted a Pop culture aesthetic to create rings, bracelets and brooches with historical references. She also draws on twentieth-century costume jewelry for her large and opulent-looking forms that reflect a fascination with glamour.  \n\nHer lastest series \"uses mass media images of models, floral motifs, architecture and design objects, which broaden her scope of cultural and social interpretations. Thus behind the visual opulence of her work she succeeds in handling relevant aesthetic and social themes in her pieces.\"",
