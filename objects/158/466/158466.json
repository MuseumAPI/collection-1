All ornament wraps around box body. Undecorated surfaces are slightly mottled. Hinge located on lower corner so that box opens on the diagonal, seperating the bead, leaf, and flower ornament from the bead and spiral. When opened, an unadorned, interior match container is revealed, also attached at corner hinge, so that it may swing from side to side. Striker attached to one side of interior container.",
