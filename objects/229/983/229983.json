  "description": "In this small genre scene, the Count d'Arjuzon, plays the violin and his wife, the guitar, in front of open French windows. A serene background of pale blue walls and bare parquet floors enhances the portrait paintings and blue painted armchairs in the style of Louis XVI. To the right of the windows, a globe is seen on a corner table; just forward of that is a white flowering plant on a draped table.",
