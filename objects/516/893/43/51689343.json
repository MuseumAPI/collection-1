    "justification": "\nCooper-Hewitt has been offered as a gift one roll of &quot;Cosmo&quot; wallpaper designed by Abigail*Ryan, a young husband and wife Belfast design team composed of Abigail and Ryan Bell. They have been designing textiles and home goods since 2009, and this paper is from their first wallpaper collection introduced in 2013. \nAbigail*Ryan takes a&amp;nbsp;hands-on approach to its designs and both principals are very much involved throughout the creative process. They begin by photographing flowers of their choosing, and then these images are hand illustrated using pen and ink. The scale of the flowers is manipulated to create a nice flow throughout the design. They select local suppliers to produce all of their products which allows for greater oversight and quality control, and also supports the local economy, ensures fair labor practices, and reduces their carbon footprint.\nThe designers chose the flexographic printing process which imparts a subtle texture and gives the design more depth. Flexographic printing is a machine process using rubber rollers, much like a rubber stamp or linoleum block in a roll. The flexography technique was developed in England in 1890, but was not used for the production of wallpaper until the 1960s. \nCooper-Hewitt\u2019s wallcoverings collection is international in scope, but the majority of its papers&amp;nbsp;were produced in France, England, Germany and the United States. While most countries manufacture some wallpaper, it is frequently produced more to meet domestic demand than for export, which limits its accessibility abroad. This will be the first wallpaper in the collection that was designed&amp;nbsp;in Ireland.\nFloral designs make up one of the largest categories in the department and are represented in most styles, periods, and techniques. Representative examples include embossed leathers, British Design Reform, Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, art nouveau, art deco, and pop art papers from the 1960-70s. The addition of this paper would help illustrate the evolution and design continuum of floral wallpaper. It would also contribute to the collection of papers by contemporary designers, which is a department priority. ",
