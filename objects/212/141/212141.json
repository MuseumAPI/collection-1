  "description": "Building on the three previous poster designs, randomly placed, brightly colored images of the Liberty Bell, a patriot firing a long rifel, a large yellow rose next to a figure of a man with a spade, are all connected by scatered dotted lines and bright areas of color. In addition, a large dump truck and several more brightly colored areas have been incorporated into the design, resulting in a hand drawn assortment of stimulating colors, contrasts and visual images.  Across the bottom of the sheet, the full title, Baseler Theater, has emerged in an assortment of formal and sketched fonts.",
