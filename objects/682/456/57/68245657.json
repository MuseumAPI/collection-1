    "description": "four dimpled plywood sliding panels on top and bottom two sections, the left side with three drawers of black lacquered wood, and metal handles, with lacquered Masonite panels in shades of taupe, beige and grey, the second level with angled braces on the left, and perforated aluminum panel on the right.",
    "justification": "The Eames Storage Unit, or ESU, is a system of lightweight, modular storage cabinets and desks constructed of lacquered Masonite panels and laminated birch plywood sliding doors and drawers, perforated aluminum panels, and zinc-plated steel supports. The series was part of the Eames's efforts to create economical, inexpensive household furniture using industrial production materials and techniques. In designing this system, the Eameses took their cue from industry, particularly the type of metal shelving found in warehouses and factories. The ESU was composed of&amp;nbsp; standardized, mass-produced, knock-down, interchangeable parts: shelves, drawers, panels, doors, and metal framework and struts that were not only durable, but could be employed to decorative effect, particularly with the use of colored panels, and texture provided by &quot;dimpled&quot; plywood doors and perforated metal screens.&amp;nbsp; The variety of color and surface choices allowed consumers to mix and match and customize their units for home and office. The units served not only as storage but came in various sizes that could also be stacked and used as room dividers.\nThe concept and forms of the ESU relate to the Eames's own &quot;case study&quot; home, built with modular, off-the-shelf industrial elements, and grew out of the Eames's earlier &quot;Cased Goods&quot; furniture of ca 1945\/1946, which was made entirely of wood. The ESU, first produced in 1950, made no attempt to hide the industrial standardized look of its components. the units were available in single and double widths, in the 100 series (1 unit high), 200 ( 2 units high)&amp;nbsp;and 400&amp;nbsp; (4 units high), as well as smaller cabinets and desks. An exercise in formal geometric design, these pieces made of industrial components exemplify a simplicity and integrity of material characteristic of the Eames's work. \nThis particular model is a First&amp;nbsp; Series example, having angled steel legs. This type of leg was replaced with a sturdier,&amp;nbsp;but slightly inset leg that included triangular supports, starting in about 1952. Production of the ESU ceased in 1955. This example, in shades of taupe, frey, beige, and ivory shars the palette of natural tones popular in the progressive interiors of the early 1950's. Made to mix and match, the resulting ESU's reflected their purchasers' tastes, so levels of aesthetic co-ordination vaary. This example is well co-ordinated.",
