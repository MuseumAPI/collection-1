  "description": "Romantic landscape vignettes in style of Watteau or Boucher. A shepherdess tends her flock seated beneath a tree. Behind, a man peeps through the branches watching her. In the distance is an old fort or castle. Above, a pair of seated lovers regard a bird in a cage which the man holds. Small village in background.",
