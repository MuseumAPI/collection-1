  "description": "This opulent salon is apparently unused: the tables are without objects and the bookcase is bare. Formal red and white striped curtains, tasselled pelmets and lace undercurtains lend majesty to the room. A painted blind in the chinoiserie style is at the center window. The walls are hung with a coral patterned fabric. Acanthus leaves are interspersed with bouquets of roses on the coral ground of the carpet. Ornaments are limited to two paintings, one featuring a Madonna and Child; a gilt-bronze clock under a glass dome; and an inkwell.",
