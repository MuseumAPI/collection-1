    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Apple's iPod and its variants are among the most influential personal appliances of the twenty-first century.&amp;nbsp; The iPod technology and distinctive, universally recognizable design make this portable media player important in the continuum of industrial design. Apple Computer, Inc. founded in 1976, by Stephen Wozniak and Steve Jobs (now CEO of the firm), was well established as an innovator in the personal computer field by the time British designer Jonathan Ive joined the company in 1992. Ive rose to become the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design, and under his design direction in 1998-99, Apple introduced the iMac and iBook personal computer and laptop lines noted for their bulging, translucent, bright gumdrop-colored housings.&amp;nbsp; By 2001, the year the iPod was introduced as Apple's entry into the growing personal digital music player market, Ive's designs shifted to a more minimalist &quot;pure&quot; aesthetic. The sleek, smooth forms in titanium or aluminum used for Apple's powerful computer products were geared toward the business world, while glossy white casings were intended for the consumer market. The original iPod with its iconic thin, rectangular shape, white face and chrome-colored back characterized this style.\nThis first generation iPod, a small, elegant form can be carried or worn almost like a piece&amp;nbsp; jewelry. The tactile appeal of the milky, translucent face is reinforced by simple shapes and contours inviting one to touch the controls- an innovative mechanical scroll wheel rather than&amp;nbsp; buttons are the main user interface-simply with the word &quot;menu&quot; and three basic directional symbols.&quot;",
