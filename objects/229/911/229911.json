  "description": "This wall elevation is typical of antique revival decoration so popular during the Neo-Classical period in France. The wall is symmetrically divided, with two double panelled doors at the center. A frieze evoking a musical theme runs across the top of the doors. A second frieze, above the lintel, shows dancing figures holding various instruments. Pilasters and large panels are decorated with grotesque elements, with urns, putti, flowers, animals and herms comprising a fanciful composition. Narrow panels decorated with musical trophies complete the elevation for a music salon, effecting an archeological reconstruction of the Etruscan period.",
