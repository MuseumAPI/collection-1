    "description":"Petticoat of glazed chintz with a deep decorative border at the bottom in blue, violet, and shades of red on a white ground. The design is arranged to fit the bottom of the petticoat, and consists of a series of pointed arches made up of floral bands, rising to sharply pointed ovals of blossoms. Between points of arches appear jars of flowers. The arched spaces frame, alternately, clusters of various blooms, or crossed, sharply pointed curved flower bands.The bottom of the skirt is finished by a border 5 3\/4 inches wide of small arches, reversed top and bottom, in blues, with red flowers on dotted red ground; intersected by a red band with floral decoration in blue or reserved in white.The painting of the arches is elaborate and a feathery effect is produced by a background of minute foliage forms in red, or dotted grounds of red, or feathery detail in black.\nIn the open space above the border are detached sprays of natural size flowers, including tulips and roses.  \nLined with stiff white linen; one seam. At top set into waistband of green twill tape with tie cords at the side.\nThe fabric was made in India, the petticoat was made in Europe, probably in The Netherlands.",
