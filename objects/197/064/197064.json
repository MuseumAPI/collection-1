  "description": "Recto: With the card in a vertical direction, the design consists of an image of an engraving of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France from 1774-1793, based on a contemporaneous engraving. Her gaze is focussed directly on the viewer and she appears to be smiling. Her bouffant wig is styled off-the-face in a pompadour and has curls cascading onto the sides of her neck. The ornamentation comprises a feather-and-jewel object entwined in the top of the hair; teardrop earrings; a necklace of a single strand of pearls, perhaps encircled by precious jewels; and in the center, just below the bustline, a brooch of round stones from which three teardrop jewels are suspended. The dress, cut off in the image above the waist, has what appear to be long sleeves, and an off-the shoulder neckline edged in a lace-trimmed scarf-like collar, knotted in the center, below which two vertical strips are superimposed, probably in a v-shape ending below the waist. Underneath the image, Marie Antoinette is imprinted in very small type; to the left of the M is a curved arrrow pointing to the image. A broken horizontal line extends from side to side across the neck, and close to the right edge, on the same line, is an illustration of an open pair of scissors.\r\nVerso: The card is divided horizontally into message and addressee spaces, with a thin black line separating the two. With the card in a vertical direction, the message emphasizes Bastille Day in large black handwritten-styled letters; the remaining information in the same style, but much smaller, letters is imprinted both above, on one line, and below in a curved line, with three columns side by side underneath.\r\nWith the card in a horizontal direction, the rectangular stamp area on the upper right is occupied by an eighteenth century style straw basket with rope edging and handles. Post Card is on one line below, followed by three narrow lines underneath each other for addressee information.",
