At the top is a rose leaf festoon tied together with a ribbon in a soft cream color.  Below is a very large medallion framed by bow of laurel leaves and berries bound together at the top and a large golden yellow ribbon in imitation of gilt bronze above.  At bottom right are two bows of a garland, its floral elements stylized, all tied to a central medallion with two ribbons streaming out of it from either side.  Below left is an escutcheon in the shape of two crossed laurel branches tied with a neat bow at the base, which frames the key hole.",
