  "description": "Design for a sepulchral monument.  Elevation view.  Staircases lead up to a platform in the center of which stands a sarcophagus upon a pedestal supported by winged skulls.  A reclining female statue lies upon the sarcophagus.  She holds a stick surrounded by a snake.  At the base of the monument, at the corners, stand two female statues.  In their gesture, they point toward the sarcophagus. Double columns support an arch and a square dome decorated, at the center, with a medallion supported by two cupids.  The sarcophagus is positioned directly below the dome.  On top of the dome stand two female statues beside a pedestal with a vase.  Next to the columns, on the exterior, are two burning candelabra.",
