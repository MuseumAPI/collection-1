    "justification": "\nSheila Hicks describes what she does and how she thinks as &quot;channels of investigation&quot;. These explorations come in all media and sizes \u2013 from pocket-size weavings, or miniatures, in silk and stainless steel to room-filled installations of linen embroidery. They reflect her studies in painting with Josef Albers and photography with Herbert Matter at Yale\u2019s School of Art and Architecture, as well as the years she lived and worked in South America studying Andean weavers and archaeological sites. \nCooper-Hewitt is fortunate enough to have twenty-four examples of Hicks\u2019s &quot;channels of investigation&quot; -- works that span most of her career as an artist and textile designer. This collection includes twenty miniatures made between 1957 and 2005 and two large panels representing her embroidered works of 1967 and 1997. The Textile department has chosen to collect this artist in-depth because of her importance to the textile field during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and also because she is one of the foremost American artists practicing today.\nPrayer Wall, made in 2012, will be the most recent work by Hicks for the collection and also the largest. It relates directly to some of her large-scale commissioned work from the 1960s for the Ford Foundation, George Jensen\u2019s Center for Advanced Design, and Eero Saarinen\u2019s CBS building (Black Rock). Hicks\u2019s collaboration with architects spans her career, beginning in the late 1950s when she met architects and engineers Luis Barragan, Ricardo Legoretta, and Felix Candela. At that time, she was moving away from presenting flat woven surfaces and inserting her work into space so that the surface, light, and color could interact.\nThe &quot;tassels&quot; which form Prayer Wall refer to our own extraordinary collection of tassels from the 17th-18th centuries. Braiding and knotting, key techniques in creating tassels are very familiar to Hicks who has used these techniques in her work over the years. In Prayer Wall, however, she wraps individual hanks of linen and then secures each one to the backing allowing the tassel to be more playful and unkempt rather than precisely controlled. \nIn searching for large Hicks\u2019 pieces over the years, the one that always seemed the most appropriate for Cooper-Hewitt was Linen Lean-to (1967-68), now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For Hicks\u2019s recent exhibition at Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Co., however, she made Prayer Wall, a more contemporary and compact version of Linen Lean-to. Although Prayer Wall is almost fifty years after Linen Lean-to, Hicks uses a similar technique and material but with a more serendipitous sensibility -- its tussled texture invites touch and becomes a wonderful surface for the play of light and shadow. Prayer Wall represents how an artist revisits a historic technique and\/or form, and translates it into contemporary language. \n",
