    "justification":"\nTsugihagi was designed by Reiko Sudo (b. 1953), one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers. Educated at Musashino Art University, she and Junichi Arai co-founded the Japanese company and store, Nuno, which produces textiles of extraordinary ingenuity and beauty, in 1984. Sudo and the other designers at Nuno combine tradition and advanced technologies with remarkable creativity, which, over the last 20 years, has lead them to the forefront of textile design.&amp;nbsp; \n\nNuno began working in 1996 with various kinds of embroidery techniques to create new effects. Tsugihagi, designed in 1997, is a combination of embroidery and collage techniques made with remnants of Nuno fabrics that are laid out to cover the surface of a base fabric. The remnants are stitched down by sewing machine, and the base fabric is dissolved away leaving a lacey and net-like patchwork of different fabrics. It can be used as a window covering or for other interior purposes. This type of embroidery technique in which the ground fabric is destroyed began in the early 1880s when they most likely used animal fibers that were dissolved by a solution of caustic soda or potash, leaving the embroidery thread of vegetable fibers intact.\n",
