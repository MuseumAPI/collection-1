  "description": "Recto: Held vertically, the postcard, in tones of green,  features a photographic image of the Eiffel Tower against a cloudy sky. At the bottom edge, pedestrians, for the most part visitors to the site, are gathered on a sidewalk. Dense bushes, to the left and right of the tower; a lamppost in the left foreground; two elevated statues; and distant buildings complete the scene. Three cut out horizontal bars, centered and underneath each other, puncture the mid-section of the tower. The uppermost and middle bars are incised to the left and right of the solid center, while the bottom bar is unbroken. \r\nVerso: Now held horizontally, the card shows the cut out bars positioned vertically in the center; the broken bars are in the left-most and middle positions and the unbroken bar is right-most. In the upper left-hand corner, the name, address and telephone number of the restaurant are imprinted on three lines. The restaurant logo appears in the upper right-hand corner.",
