    "description": "Orange, green, and yellow striped hat with a large cluster of finger-like projections or burls on each side. Each projection is also striped and the shape is reinforced with a wood splint. A small tassel hangs from the center back.",
    "justification": "Traditional African hats are highly expressive of the diversity of the continent. Hats can serve a religious or ceremonial function or indicate the occupation or hierarchy of the wearer in civic or social societies. It can also indicate the marital status of the man or woman. \nIn Cameroon, hats are one of the oldest and most important parts of the national dress. There are several types of hats worn in the Cameroon Grasslands, and this particular type is an ashetu, or a prestige hat. This sort of hat is generally reserved for elite males as well as a very limited number of elite women. Fitting snuggly on the head, the hat supports the striped projections or burls that are on both sides. The whole crown of the hat may be covered with burls or, as in this example, it may be divided on the left and right sides by vertical lines of color. The burls reflect the tufted hairstyle worn by high-ranking men in Cameroon culture. \n   \nThe museum has a small collection of African hats primarily made out of raffia with a basket-weave technique. This Cameroon hat, however, represents a very different technique: crocheted wool with wood-reinforced burls. Not only is it stylistically different, but it is also geographically distinctive from other, similar hats in the collection, most of which originate from Zaire (known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo). This proposed acquisition also adds to the museum\u2019s larger collection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats spanning several centuries and continents that most often relates to the technique of embroidery.",
    "gallery_text": "The burls on each side of the ashetu hat are seen as physical manifestations of the wearer\u2019s inner head, considered the center of intelligence and spirituality. This green, gold, and orange example was probably made after Cameroon achieved independence and adopted the pan-African colors for its flag. A nearly identical hat was worn by the new Fon, Jinabo II, in 1976, when he was presented to the public for the first time.[1] \n\n\n\n\n[1] Lorenz Homburger, ed., Cameroon: Art and Kings (Zurich: Museum Rietberg, 2008), 83.",
    "label_text": "The ashetu hat supports projections or burls on each side, which reflect the tufted hairstyles once worn by high-ranking men. These projections are also seen as physical manifestations of the inner head, considered the center of intelligence and spirituality. The hat\u2019s bold colors are those of independent Cameroon\u2019s flag.",
