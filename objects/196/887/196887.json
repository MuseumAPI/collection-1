The design's border consists of a thick black band on the exterior separated by a white space from a narrow one on the interior. A Memphis studio-style step shape is incised in the center of the lower border edge. A cartoon-like sketch of the Memphis (condominiums) downtown building is placed on the diagonal, upper right to lower left, in the center. A curved line of type, followed underneath by five straight lines, is in the lower half on the right. On the left, a full-length column of copy ends in Memphis [logo]/ downtown, followed by the address and offering information.",
