    "biography":"Handweaver, designer, and teacher, Isabel Scott first learned to weave at the age of seven from her mother while living in Scotland. She studied design, knitting and embroidery in France and the United States, and worked for Berta Frey in New York. In 1948, Scott opened her own studio, which eventually expanded to two studios, one in New York and another in Philadelphia. She taught weaving at several schools and exhibited throughout the United States, including at the Metropolitan and MoMA. Scott\u2019s textiles can be found at the United Nations, executive offices of the United States Steel Company in Pittsburgh, and in many other public venues. Her pieces are used extensively by interior decorators. At her Philadelphia studio, she has adapted her designs to a power loom for industrial use.",
