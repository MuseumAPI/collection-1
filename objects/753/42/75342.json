A deep yellow rose border surrounds the sampler on three sides. In the upper half, a box framed by a smaller floral vine border contains a verse and inscription. \r\nThe verse reads:\r\nJesus permit thy gracious name to stand\r\nAs the first efforts of a youthful hand\r\nAnd while my fingers on the canvass move\r\nEngage my tender heart to see thy love\r\nWith thy dear children let me have a part\r\nAnd write thy name thyself upon my heart\r\n",
