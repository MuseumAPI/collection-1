    "description": "Recto: above the entablature is an attic with an eagle in front crowned by a wreath and standing above the console which forms the keystone. Two suggestions are made for the motif of the displayed and inverted wings of the eagle, addorsed at right. The eagle had first been projected bigger and the points of the wings being extended toward the corners of the entablature. In the opening of the archway is a pencil sketch of the upper part of a window and above it another of a console. Verso: the man is in classical armor and seen from the back with the head turned toward left. Above is a study of a part of the profile.",
