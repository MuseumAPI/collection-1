  "description": "Bright orange-tinged yellow paper is bound in a pad and imprinted with the company logo: on a black diagonally placed rectangular field, the upper and lower edges concave, The/ Stat/ Store is imprinted in the background color, with the type lines emulating the curves. The gray shadows on the right and lower edges suggest that the edges of a book are being riffled. The company's telephone number on one line of type just above the bottom edge completes the design.",
