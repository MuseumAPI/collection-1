    "biography": "Two textile salesmen, Fredrich Baumann and Albert Brand, founded Cr\u00e9ation Baumann in 1886 for the production and sale of linen. In 1905, after twenty years of successful trading Baumann and Brand decided to go their separate ways. Baumann took over the linen mill, which had survived the economic crisis of the world wars, and was then inherited and redesigned by his son Fritz Baumann. At the end of the 1950\u2019s, the company began to use the name and label Cr\u00e9ation Baumann, by which we know it today. In 1960\u2019s they hired the company\u2019s first full time textile designer and by 1966 they began to open showrooms in Zurich, Paris and Frankfurt. In the following years the company made progressive changes in their use of new technology, architecture, and branding. \n\nThe head of the company, J\u00f6rg Baumann, acquired a house in Bergamo, Italy to use as a residence for young artists and creative retreats.
