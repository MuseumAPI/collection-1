The individual&amp;nbsp;pieces\u2014a ring, two neck rings, and five pendants\u2014speak not only of mid-century trends in jewelry design, but also of the donor, Merle Sternberg,&amp;nbsp;and her friendship with the designer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sternberg&amp;nbsp;commissioned&amp;nbsp;Smith to make the gold ring as her wedding ring in 1961. She and her husband were married on September 9th of that year. Smith also made the neck rings and created the five pendants to be used interchangeably with them. The stones mounted in the pendants are ones&amp;nbsp;Sternberg and her husband picked up off a beach. Smith created and worked the silver and silver wire forms incorporating the polished stones specifically for Sternberg, showing another side of his creativity\u2014each object carries a sentimental meaning in addition to expressing an organic, free-form aesthetic that is such a strong characteristic of his work.",
