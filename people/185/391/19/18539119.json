    "biography": "Founded in Tokyo in 1975, ID\u00c9E Japan seeks to incorporate beauty and function into its designs for everyday objects. The firm creates furniture and objects and undertakes planning projects that infuse interiors with organic, airy modernism. Originally incorporated under the name Kurosaki Trade Co., Ltd., the company changed its name to Corporation ID\u00c9E in 1992. The enterprise includes a number of workshops, retail stores, and caf\u00e9s, and frequently collaborates with other brands, most notably the Japanese retail company Muji, of which it is now a subsidiary. ID\u00c9E\u2019s designs are essentially Japanese but draw heavily on the vocabulary of Scandinavian mid-century modernism.",
