    "description": "Small embroidered picture depicting the story of Judith and Holofernes, worked almost entirely in knot stitches on white silk using colored silks and metallic threads. Judith, holding a sword in one hand and the head of Holofernes in the other, is about to drop the head into a sack which her attendant holds out. The body of Holofernes is seen just behind her, inside a tent. In the background are an encampment of tents, the walls and towers of a settlement, and mountains. Judith is dressed in a mantle and pointed headdress. The attendant is dressed in simpler costume of buff skirt and blue overdress with a scarf and headdress. The faces are worked in knot stitch and only details of eyebrows, lips and hair are in satin stitch.",
