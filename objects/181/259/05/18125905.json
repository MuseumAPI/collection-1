    "description":"Edge to edge, the paper is filled with a depiction of the elevation of the front side of an alcove. The left pole of the alcove is in the shape of a column with a running putto; the right is like a plant, held by a boy. Inside this alcove is an image of another elevation, within the central arcade. There, the poles consist of plants rising from vases standing on pedestals, with curtains above all. At left, parts of a pilaster decorated with rinceaux and of a coffered arch appear inside the left arcade.",
