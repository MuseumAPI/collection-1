    "biography": "Manfred Bischoff was a skilled goldsmith and jewelry artist, who approached his work as a poet and philosopher, who appreciated life\u2019s enigmas. Born in Germany in 1947, Bischoff\u2019s career as an artist began with a goldsmithing apprenticeship. From 1972 to 1977, he studied with Reinhold Reiling at the Fachhochschule fur Gestaltung in Pforzheim. He went on to study at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Munich, from 1977-1982, under prominent goldsmith Herman Junger. He later moved from Germany to the Tuscany region of Italy, where he felt more at home and less restricted.\n\nNarrative, subjectivity, and the human condition were important concepts to Bischoff. His works are simultaneously tender and irreverent, witty and probing. Though he claimed that his jewelry \u201chas no purpose other than to be there, to exist,\u201d Bischoff always carefully titled his pieces in a way that would suggest there is more to his work than simple existence [1]. He worked primarily in gold, jade, and coral, claiming that the fine quality of his materials elevated the subject matter of his work. In 1992, Bischoff was awarded the Francois van den Bosch Prize. The jury praised Bischoff\u2019s \u201cability to make visible in his jewellery universal themes like fear, lust, death, and sexuality in a personal and narrative manner\u201d [2]. Bischoff is widely considered to be one of Europe\u2019s significant goldsmiths of the twentieth century.\n\n\n[1] Manfred Bischoff, quoted in Helen W.
