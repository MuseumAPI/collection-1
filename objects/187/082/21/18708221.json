    "description":"The Rococo Revival desk is placed at right angles to the window to catch the light. The center table is covered with a rust-colored cloth bordered by a pattern in the oriental style, similar to that of the carpet. The folding chair placed against the rear wall is in the style of chair maker George Hunzinger. The ormolu-mounted, ebonized cabinet between the windows on the right holds precious ornaments. In front of the elaborate marble fireplace in the left hand corner is a fire screen inset with an embroidered panel featuring a white horse in parade regalia on a ground of brilliant green.",
