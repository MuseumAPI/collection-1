    "justification":"This textile was designed by Osamu Mita (b.1963), a third generation textile designer living in Kiryu, an important textile manufacturing town in Japan. He was educated at Kokugakuin University and now designs for the family textile company, Mitasho, where this textile was manufactured. He primarily uses wool with various other fiber combinations and employs special finishing techniques to achieve unusual surfaces and textures.\nWool Dot Gather, designed in 1993, is made of wool and rayon, and has a very rich textural surface created by a combination of patterning in the weaving process, as well as shrinking in the finishing. The white plain woven wool forms both the dots and stripes, while the white rayon forms the pleats in between. Mita\u2019s innovation is in his ability to understand and exploit the unique properties of the different yarns to create a particular and premeditated effect. This textile is meant to be used both for fashion purposes as well as for interior decoration. ",
