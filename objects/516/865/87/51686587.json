    "description": "An outer rectangular frame in steel-colored aluminum, surrounding a black cuff of anodyzed aluminum, the top of the bracelet with two rectangles of anodyzed aluminum with upbent corners, with a rectangular box of black and white onyx chequerboard",
    "justification": "One of the most innovative of American jewelry designers in aluminum with mixed metals and materials starting in the early 1980's, David Tisdale brought new concepts to jewelry . Sometimes in concert with precious or semi-precious materials such as sterling silver, diamonds,&amp;nbsp;onyx or tiger eye, he has used planes or forms within forms and sculptural ideas to wear. His use of aluminum is not confined to jewelry. Cooper-Hewitt has examples of wonderfully colored anodyzed aluminum flatware -one called Picnic produced by his studio in multi colors, the other -called Electra-in pink and blue handles&amp;nbsp;with aluminum&amp;nbsp; designed for Sasaki , both designed in 1986-the year after this bracelet, that share some of the interest in planar forms and expanding aluminum's realm.&amp;nbsp; This bracelet exemplifies his jewelry work of this period, and connects two areas of the collection, the large flatware and cutlery collection with the jewelry. Both of these areas of the collection have design examples from early history to the present day that show the ever-creative design thinking for adorning the table and the body. \nTisdale's designs function as art objects for the body, but suggest a narrative. Much of the jewelry of the 1980's was concerned with a mixture of emotions, narrative and installation art. It also wanted to suggest interaction with the body.&amp;nbsp; While not overtly narrative, the bracelet begs one to think about the juxtaposition of white and black, on a grey ground, and what the meaning might be of the diagonal lines that lead out of this almost piece-of-cake like fixture on the top. Yet it is more concerned with supporting ing this statement while&amp;nbsp;using cuff was to hug to the body, allowing the rectangular part around it to display a sort of table of design held in place for a viewer to see projected out.\nTisdale has been featured in many important exhibitions for his jewelry, and lectured on the use of anodyzed aluminum as a groundbreaker in the use of this medium in jewelry.&amp;nbsp; While he has continued to work with the metal, this bracelet represents the early phase of when he was innovating and working with the forms and structure that became his signature.&amp;nbsp; ",
