    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The iPhone is among&amp;nbsp; the newest innovative designs by Apple Computer, Inc.&amp;nbsp; One of the most influential of&amp;nbsp; the communications devices in a category called &quot;smartphones&quot; -they are more than just mobile phones, these devices have advanced capabilities and computer-like functionality. They can run operating system software and have features such as e-mail, Internet capability, as well as a keyboard, whether built in or external, like miniature computers with telephones.\nResponding to the burgeoning market for smart phones and building on its iPod series, Apple began developing the iPhone when CEO Steve Jobs asked the company's engineers to investigate touch screens almost three years before the iPhone's 2007 debut.&amp;nbsp; The firm collaborated with Cingular Wireless (now AT&amp;T Mobility), but Apple developed the iPhone's innovative hardware and software in-house. Jobs unveiled the product in January, 2007, and it went on sale that June. The iPhone was hotly anticipated, with thousands of people lined up at Apple Stores throughout the US hours before they went on sale. The iPhone is more than a cell phone:&amp;nbsp; its multiple functions (phone, email, Internet, music player, camera\/image storage, and more), combined with its touch screen, clean, sleek appearance, and ease of use to attract consumers of all ages.\nWith a monolithic slab that is light and comfortable in the hand, almost all of the iPhone's face is covered with a glass screen that displays easy-to-read brightly-colored application &quot;widgets&quot; and graphics.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Among the most significant iPhone innovations is a touch-sensitive surface activated by a bare finger, not a stylus. The sophisticated screen responds to various touch gestures accessing content with a touch, tap, pinch or pull to move it with a touch-drag motion, or scroll with either an up-down or side-to-side sliding motion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The display responds to three sensors allowing it to dim when not near the face or hand, and to shift from portrait to landscape mode depending on the orientation of the phone.&quot;",
