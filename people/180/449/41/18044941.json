    "biography": "Best known for his works in glass, George Sakier\u2019s career spanned a diverse range of disciplines. Sakier studied at Columbia University\u2019s engineering school and at Pratt Institute. At age 19 he composed the text for \u201cMachine Design and Descriptive Geometry\u201d before going on to design and paint camouflage patterns during World War I. Following the war, he taught machine design and engineering mathematics before working in art direction for a number of magazines including Vogue and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Throughout his career he also produced paintings ranging from abstract landscapes and compositions to what he referred to as \u201cRealistic Landscapes\u201d that documented the world as he saw it. Sakier served as the primary design consultant for the Fostoria Glass Company for fifty years, producing designs for the firm between 1929 and 1979. While these range from classic to modern, Sakier is best known for his work in the art deco style. In 1934 Sakier served as head of the Bureau of Design Development of American Radiator and Sanitary Corporation, where he designed faucets and prefabricated, mass-produced unit bathrooms. Sakier was featured in Fortune Magazine\u2019s seminal 1934 article about the emerging field of industrial design along with fellow pioneers Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy, and Walter Dorwin Teague.",
