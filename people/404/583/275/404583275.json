    "biography": "Studio Ars et Labor Industrie Riunite (S.A.L.I.R.) was founded in 1923 by Guglielmo Barbini, Giuseppe D\u2019Alpaos and Gino Franceschetti, decorators from the cold-work shop of the Cristalleria Franchetti, and Decio Toso. The work of the firm mainly involved engraving (diamond, wheel, sandblasting), intaglio, enamel decoration, and the gilding of blown glass, mirrors, and decorative panels. \nIn 1927, Guido Balsamo Stella and Franz Pelzel joined S.A.L.I.R., with Balsamo Stella becoming the artistic director and Pelzel becoming the technical director. Balsamo Stella would remain with S.A.L.I.R. for only five years, although his designs continued to be produced after his departure. Pelzel\u2019s reputation as a leading engraver prompted him to found a school at the firm to train students in figurative engraving. He would remain with S.A.L.I.R. until his retirement in 1968.\nThe models engraved and enameled in the 1930s were conceived by Franz Pelzel, Vittorio Zecchin, Gio Ponti, Pietro Fornasetti, and Atte Gasparetto. Later, Pelzel and his students engraved modern designs by independent collaborators such as Pietro Pelzel, Ettore Sottsass, Serena Dal Maschio, Vinicio Vianello, and Agostino Venturini. The company continues to carry on business.  It remains privately owned, and is directed by the heirs \nof the original founders.",
