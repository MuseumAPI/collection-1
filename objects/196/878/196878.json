The whole would then have been folded in sixths for mailing. The sheet is divided into three vertical strips, of which the center is imprinted entirely with a narrative about DIFFA, and the right and left consist of an all over pattern of irregular circular forms, outlined in black,  perhaps based on either cells or reptile skin.",
