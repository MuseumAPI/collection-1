    "gallery_text": "Explorer 1 was the first successful US Earth-orbiting satellite. As with many tools of exploration, the satellite\u2019s design was determined by its history and use. After successful launches from the Soviet Union and a failed American attempt, Explorer 1 was rapidly developed to achieve orbit. It was mounted externally on top of a modified sounding rocket, an arrangement that required the satellite to incorporate its own rocket booster\u2014it took up the back half\u2014to achieve final orbit. The launch method also called for a conical nose, to minimize drag during ascent through the atmosphere. Explorer 1\u2019s front half contained detectors for cosmic rays and micrometeorites, electronics, batteries, and communication equipment. Four radio antennas extended from the middle of the satellite.",
