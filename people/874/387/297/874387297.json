    "biography": "Peter Hoogeboom was born in Leiden on March 3, 1961. He lives and works in Amsterdam. He studied at the jewelry department of the Gerrit Rieveld Academy in Amsterdam, graduating in 1992. Since 1995, his medium of choice for jewelry has been ceramics, particularly porcelain.\n\nFor millenia ceramics have been used  as beads. Recognizing the utilitarian function of the material, Hoogeboom wants to again utilize it as a primary material for body ornament. Hoogeboom strives to use clay in innovative ways in the construction of his jewelry. Using the method of slip casting, he can replicate the many hollow, relatively strong and lightweight elements used to build his decorative objects and wearable pieces.",
