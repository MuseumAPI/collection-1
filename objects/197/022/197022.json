  "description": "The design is worked in a black, white and red color scheme on newsprint; the white is actually the ground, that is, newsprint color. Beginning about mid-page on the left, close to the left-hand edge, and continuing upward, the words Paint Sale, in bold red capitals, are imprinted parallel to the left-hand edge. 25% Off follows horizontally underneath the P. In a full page photograph, a Dalmatian dog is posed with his head located in the upper right and facing right and his body slanted toward the lower left; he sits on his back legs with his front legs unbent and slanted toward the lower right-hand corner. Several red dots are scattered in the midsection of the black and white coat. Just underneath the mouth, Set Shop, in red capitals, heads six lines of type, the last underlined in red; following underneath is a two column list, twenty-seven lines each, of paint names. The Set Shop logo, on the bottom right, is comprised of a stencil-style S in red on a white circle, surrounded by a circular red band, imprinted with the company name, address and telephone number.",
