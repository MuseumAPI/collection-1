  "description": "Sheet cut down to make a rectangle slightly larger in width than height.  Depicted is a stone, carved well head with Christian iconography.  The well is in the shape of a capital.  It is raised on a small square plinth with canted corners.  The main sculptural composition consists of two figures kneeling, their arms resting on one bent knee to support a cross inscribed within two circles, like a Greek cross. There is a small diamond-pattern molding above.  The well appears to have a two-sided cover that hinges in the middle and, when opened, the cover rests against an ironwork scroll.  A chain hangs over the edge of the well on the right.  At the bottom left is the well head in plan view.  A scale is indicated for each sketch.",
