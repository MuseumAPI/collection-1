    "description": "The present black and white photograph features a prototype of Gustav Jensen's patented design for a table-top radio cabinet, here positioned on a round glass table resting on a carpet. In the background is a furniture unit composed of a sofa-with-attached-end-tables fabricated of a hard-surfaced material, perhaps marble or plastic, and a seat cushion and arm rests, apparently of tufted velvet.  The featured object, a round radio cabinet on a cylindrical pedestal, has five ziggurat levels, beginning about midway and diminishing in size from there to the top; the sound is emitted through the openings. The tuning dial is located on the base. The carpet, visible through the table top and beyond, features a design of swirling flowers in a lighter tone than the background.",
