    "justification": "Justification Text from Accession file:\nThe low, stable form of the stool, exhibits the rational construction that characterizes Ilmari Tapiovaara's work.&amp;nbsp; The stool is made up of six components: four legs and a seat in two sections. Other pieces in the Pirkka line include a side chair, bench and table. This stool shows the original finish, with the seat in a natural, light-toned wood on ebonized wood legs. \nTapiovaara studied industrial and interior design at Finland's Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki (graduating in 1937). His designs reflect his conviction that an object's function and structural conception should be readily visible.&amp;nbsp; He developed an aesthetic that incorporated influences of the architects and manufacturers that he worked for, each a major figure of mid-century modern style: Alvar Aalto, in Artek's London Office (1935-36); Le Corbusier in Paris (1937); and Mies van der Rohe in Chicago (1952-53).&amp;nbsp; He was a pioneer in the design of low cost &quot;knock-down&quot; furniture for Finland's expanding post-war exports of the late 1940s-1950s. That furniture had additional advantages: its components could be efficiently packed for overseas shipping and could be easily assembled after delivery.\nTapiovaara became particularly well known for functional furniture such as the stackable, bentwood Domus and Lukki I chairs that he initially designed for institutional use at the Domus Academy (1947) and the Tech Student Village (1951), respectively.&amp;nbsp; He also earned a reputation as a practical businessman.&amp;nbsp; He served as art director for the furniture firm of Askon Tehaat (1937-40), and later for the major furniture manufacturer Asko (1938-41).&amp;nbsp; He founded the cabinetwork factory of Keravan Puuteollisuus (1941-51), and maintained creative and commercial control by serving as both artistic and managing director.&amp;nbsp; In addition to these business activities and teaching, he and his wife, Annikki, set up their own design consultancy firm (1950), which accepted furniture and industrial design commissions from a variety of companies. Though best known for his designs of interiors and furniture, he also designed lighting, glass, cutlery, carpets, textiles (often with his wife), and radio and stereo components, as late as the mid-1970s.\nMid-twentieth century Scandinavian design exerted a remarkable and enduring influence on modern design.&amp;nbsp; Finland and Finnish designers such as Tapiovaara contributed significantly to the development of the modern aesthetic. The few examples of Finnish furniture in the Museum's collection represent the work of five designers who practiced between the late 1920s and the 1980s: two examples of a stacking side chair, and one bentwood lounge chair (1929-30) by Alvar Aalto; a birch sauna stool (1952) by Antti Nurmisniemi, a fiberglass and plastic &quot;Pastilli&quot; chair (1968) by Eero Aarnio, and a contemporary plywood and metal armchair (1981) by designers Wmo Heikkila and Yrjo Wiherheimo.&amp;nbsp; This stool is a welcome addition to the holdings.&amp;nbsp; It would be our only design by Tapiovaara, adding a strong example of Finnish mid-century design and enhancing our ability to show a representative display of our group of &quot;Scandinavian modern&quot; pieces.",
