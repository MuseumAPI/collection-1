    "description":"The hexagon-shaped paper is composed of multiple layers of printing containing delicate floral imagery interspersed with circular geometric shapes. The background is composed of a grid pattern. Printed in black, gray and taupe on a white ground. The first of seven identical panels.",
    "justification":"The striking hexagonal form of each piece on this wallpaper allows a considerable degree of installation flexibility because each panel can be rotated as desired to create a more random looking repeat.&amp;nbsp; The decorative design is screen-printed in six colors, giving the paper a sense of depth while the intricate lace-like patterns and layering keeps ones' eyes moving around the dynamic design.&amp;nbsp; Overall decoration is characteristic of Wanders's current work and Hexagon's shape combined with the variegated patterning gives the effect of quilting when installed. The paper is available in four colorways - black, red, yellow, and brown, with black being the most dramatic and elegant.",
