  "description": "East Sutton Place Kent (parts of which dated back to the time of Henry VIII), was the family seat of Sir Edmund Filmer, Baronet and Member of Parliament. The Elizabethan intricately-carved walls and ceiling is reflected in the square design of the marble floor. The Elizabethan  hall chairs, suits of armor and Oriental ceramics all probably close to the original Tudor scheme for the entrance hall.",
