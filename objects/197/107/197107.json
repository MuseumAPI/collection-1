  "description": "The page is divided approximately in thirds, horizontally, with the background of the upper and lower sections in white and the mid-section in black. A man's fedora in gray tones, with a black band, is diagonally placed and centered in the upper section and a man's laced leather shoe, also in gray tones, is in the same position in the lower section. The words hat, shoe and gesundheit are imprinted in small capitals on one line underneath the hat. New Republic, in white bold, serif-styled type, measuring one-third the height of the midsection, is centered there. Above the shoe, in the same type used in the upper section, and also on one line, is the third word in the store name, clothiers, followed by the address and phone number.",
