  "description": "In the upper left-hand corner is a frontal view of the head of a female with downcast eyes; full, closed lips; and curly hair cascading from the top of the head, center, down the sides of the face to just below chin level. Shading appears around the eyes and in the lower face. \r\n\r\nBelow, to the right and just left of center is a female in right profile. Curly hair frames the face; an upturned nose, full mouth and rounded chin comprise the profile outline, which is heavily shaded on the outside.\r\n\r\nTwo ornaments occupy the lower part of the page on the left; an additional, incomplete one is on the right. \r\n\r\nIn the upper right hand corner, Jensen has written in script: the party that should be elected is the one/ that can unite the country.",
