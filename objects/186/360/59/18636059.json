Below is an irregular cornice colored brown and with bright green scrollwork designs, which supports four red and white striped columns with abstract black designs at their bases.  A central pole runs through the structure and it is articulated with the same scrollwork design of the cornice.  The closed lower portion of the structure is divided into several horizontal bands of decoration articulated with abstract and geometric forms.  Left: A blue and white striped triangular roof pavilion with a red striped pole on each end.  The closed lower portion of the structure is articulated with an upper band of geometric designs in red, white, and blue and rows of square plaques below with similar decorative schemes.",
