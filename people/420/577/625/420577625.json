    "biography": "The Herculaneum Pottery Company, in Liverpool, England,  made pearlware, creamware and bone china porcelain on a large scale especially from 1800-1830.  They produced a lot of transfer-printed wares suitable for the American market and thus had large exports, as well as a robust domestic market. One line included scenes based on the drawings, pastels and prints after Adam Buck, an Irish-born portrait miniaturist whose work is synonymous with Regency England.",
