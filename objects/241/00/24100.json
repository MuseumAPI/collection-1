  "description": "Cast iron radiator (-1b) in the form of a podium surmounted by an arch forming a niche for a standing draped figure (-1a) of a woman holding a Greek drinking goblet in either hand (-1d,e).  A composite entablature is surmounted by a Doric cornice crowned by a semi-circular tympanum.  The podium base is decorated with bas-reliefs of columns alternating with Greek vases surrounded by drapery at the lower level and repeated scene of a griffin and man pouring liquid into a bowl in the upper level.  The arch itself is decorated with bas-reliefs of rosettes and scrolls on two supporting pilasters with fluted capitals.  The tympanum has a bas-relief of an eagle clutching a staff from which springs ribbons bearing \"Stratton\" and Seymour\".  Stars decorate tympanum, following the semi-circular curve.  Radiator stands on four detachable scrolled legs (-1f/i).  The fender (-1c) is comprised of grille work formed by scrolls, acanthus leaves and rosettes.  Flat circular flue key (-1j) with stylized foliate handle fits on pipe behind tympanum.",
