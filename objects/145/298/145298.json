  "description": "Four circles, each 11.5 inches in diameter, place in the four quarters of a square in natural linen on a natural linen background. Each circle is a fanning of stretched yarns floating on the surface of the foundation fabric produced by the progressive counter-clockwise placing of yarns on the diameter of the circle. A relief is created in the center of each circle as the yarns cross and build up one upon the other. The yarns are attached to the foundation fabric in the manner of embroidery.",
