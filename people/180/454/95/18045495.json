    "biography": "California Drop Cloth is a hand painted upholstery house. It was founded in the mid-1970\u2019s by Leonard Pollikof. Pollikof began by repurposing drop cloths used by painters, which he would dry clean and use as upholstery. The first showroom to carry his collection of repurposed drop cloth upholstery was in the Pacific Design Center. In 1978 Pollikof teamed up with Eric Jones in the creation of an interactive upholstery store on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. Inside the store was a single table covered with a plethora of painting tools with which patrons of the store could create their own hand-painted fabrics. The table also contained a notebook with instructions for mixing paint colors. Visitors to the store were able to use these materials and interactively create their own upholstery. In the same year California Drop Cloth was mentioned in Egon Von Furstenburg\u2019s book The Power Look at Home, which boosted the company\u2019s sales and allowed Pollikof to continue to build the business.",
