    "biography": "The work of Dutch designer Pepe Heykoop straddles two worlds\u2014the collectible pieces made in his Amsterdam studio, and the retail products made with women in an informal settlement in Mumbai, India, as part of the Tiny Miracles Foundation. Yet these two facets of his practice are not incompatible. Both reflect Heykoop\u2019s idealism and vision as a designer; both enable his exploration in the handmade. Recycling is at the heart of many of Heykoop\u2019s designs.",
