    "description":"Design for a circular table: plan, elevation, and detail. Plan of table shows veined pattern; detail of elevation where table top meets support; elevation shows three legs in wishbone-like design that join at the top. Left margin, column of printed text in light gray. Inscriptions in graphite throughout.",
    "justification":"This Design for the Leaf Table (fabricated object in High Museum, Atlanta) marks a fairly new area of collecting, for the Drawings, Prints and Graphic Design department, that of documenting the 3-D prototyping process. &amp;nbsp;It will be the second such design drawing to enter the Museum\u2019s collections.&amp;nbsp; Two years ago, DPGD acquired a drawing by Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec for the Vegetal Chair (2011-30-1) which was produced by Vitra using prototyping equipment as part of the design process.&amp;nbsp; The drawing for the Leaf Table, which is being donated to the Museum by Marc Benda of Friedman Benda Gallery, explores a much more complicated design that was fabricated by similar technology. \nThe drawing falls into the category of nature-based design (biotechnology) which many designers and computer engineers are exploring today.&amp;nbsp; Like Laarman\u2019s celebrated 2007 Bone Chair, the design is based on a computer algorithm that mimics the way bones grow in nature, adding or diminishing material where strength is needed or not required.&amp;nbsp; This study, a presentation drawing, was made for the 2010 exhibition at the Friedman Benda gallery to explain in detail to the dealer as well as to the viewer\/client, what the table would look like pre-construction, and what materials would be used in its final fabrication.&amp;nbsp; This monumental and impressive piece can be admired not only for its meticulous engineering detail, but also as for its beauty, which recalls a transparent view of the human body.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",
