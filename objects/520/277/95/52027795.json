    "justification": "\nOrigami Pleat was designed in 1997 by Reiko Sudo, one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers and co-founder of Nuno Corporation.&amp;nbsp; The textile&amp;nbsp;is a contemporary interpretation of centuries-old hand pleating. It is made by creating a paper &quot;mold&quot; using&amp;nbsp;an origami or Japanese paper-folding technique.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;polyester fabric is then &quot;pushed&quot; into the paper mold and clipped together so that when subjected to heat the polyster will retain the&amp;nbsp;sharp, crisp angles of the paper. Color&amp;nbsp;is achieved by using&amp;nbsp;colored dye-transfer paper in the paper mold.&amp;nbsp; When the fabric and paper go through the heat-transfer process,&amp;nbsp;colors are transferred and&amp;nbsp; pleats are permanently pressed. The gradations of color are dependent upon how close the fabric is to the color&amp;nbsp;paper.&amp;nbsp; Origami Pleat was included in the exhibition, Structure and Surface: Contemporary Japanese Textiles, organized by The Museum of Modern Art and The Saint Louis Art Museum in 1998. \nThe Textile department accessioned a much larger piece in 2004 (2004-18-1) and is proposing this for acquisition because of its smaller size.",
