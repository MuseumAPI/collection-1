    "justification": "This stool is a significant example of a functional piece designed by the contemporary artist, Robert Wilson. While Wilson has been called one of America's foremost architecture-based contemporary chair designers, he is best known as a director of experimental theater, stage designer, performance artist, writer, painter, and printmaker. Born in Texas, Wilson studied at the University of Texas before completing an architecture degree at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. \nThe Queen stool would be a fine addition to the museum\u2019s collection, adding to a group of artist-created product design and decorative arts objects that includes ceramics designed by Pablo Picasso and Cindy Sherman and a mirror designed by Jim Dine. The stool also relates to a group of design sketches for theater sets, dating from 1990 (1992-90-1\/27).",
