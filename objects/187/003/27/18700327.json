    "justification":"Junichi Arai, an important innovator in 20th century textiles, was born in 1932 in Kiryu, a city that has been an important center for textile production in Japan for four centuries. As the sixth generation of a mill-owning family, Arai grew up with fabrics being woven for obis and kimonos. He maintains a deep reverence for traditional weaving techniques and the capabilities that only the hand can provide in the craft of making fabrics. In 1984 he founded Nuno Corporation, a company and retail store that produces and sells innovative functional fabrics. Though his work is very technically innovative, Arai takes a traditional approach with his company by employing local craftspeople to help create his work. He has expanded the potential of a jacquard loom, explored reflective surfaces using polyester slit yarn, developed new interpretations of age-old techniques such as ikat and shibori (tie-dye), and exploited the thermoplastic memories of synthetic fibers to give flat fabrics and third dimension. Because of his extensive work, Arai holds patents on 36 processes.\nReflecting Well by Arai continues his life-long investigation of materials and textile techniques and transforming two-dimensional cloth into sculptural and vibrant surfaces.&amp;nbsp; In this piece which is comprised of polyester and aluminum, Arai combines a melt-off technique, which dissolves the metallic thread leaving behind a transparent cloth, and shibori, a type of tie-dyeing technique that, in Reflecting Well, ultimately protects the metallic areas when dyeing the cloth. The results are large, circular, metallic puckers that reflect light and create an incredibly animated cloth.&amp;nbsp; ",
