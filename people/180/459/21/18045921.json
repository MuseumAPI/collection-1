    "biography": "Eddie Squires joined Warner & Sons Ltd. (now Warner Fabrics) in 1963, a year after graduating from the Central School in London. He worked for the company for the next thirty years, becoming associate director in 1980 and director from 1984-1993. Squire helped Warner develop a reputation for combining high-quality fabrics with innovative, new designs. Squires demonstrated sensitivity to traditional patterns within the framework of his commitment to modern design. He frequently looked to historical, architectural, and ethnic sources for inspiration. Even his youthful-pop-oriented designs were often inspired by designs he had seen on old objects, such as a carpet at the Victoria and Albert Museum. But Squires also drew inspiration from concepts of the future and from technological innovations. Computers and electrical circuits, for instance, inspired his \u2018Programmed Pattern Collection\u2019 of textiles printed with distorted digital imagery. Additionally, Squires prints have a psychedelic quality to them which can in part be attributed to his interest in pop art and pop culture of the 1970\u2019s. His prints reference pop art such as that of Andy Warhol and pop culture such as in his Lunar Rocket pattern, which was created to celebrate the lunar landing of Apollo 11th.",
