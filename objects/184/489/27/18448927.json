    "description":"In upper half of sheet, center, a small two-toned green leaf, vertically oriented.  At the left edge of leaf, a suggestion of a shadow in dark brown.  At right edge, the suggestion of light bordered by a horizontal block of gray resembling haze.  These superimposed on a large green and brown leaf placed diagonally to the left and covering almost the full length of sheet.  At lower left, flush with margin, a photo mechanical reproduction of a country lane with distant farm buildings.  A line describing a rectangle is superimposed asymmetrically on the photograph.  Flush with the lower right corner of photo, a gray circle bisected by a dark brown rectangular bar, the symbol for the London Underground. In upper right corner, in very large outlined captal letters, partly superimposed on the larger leaf:  SPRING; at center left, in smaller green and brown capital letters:  IN THE VILLAGE.",
