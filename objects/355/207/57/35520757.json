Upper left: a post and lintel structure with three posts or trees and a lintel across two of them, containing three large rectangular forms or boxes, an arrow points to the structure from the right and the number 1 encircled; upper right: post and lintel structure with four trees as posts, large rectangular boxes flank each post, an arrow points at it from the right next to the number 2 encircled; center right: three trees among a group of rectangular boxes of various sizes, an arrow points at it from the right; center: five trees, two of which are only partially finished, between these are shelving structures as tall as the trees, the number 3 encircled on the right; lower left: three posts flanked by four vertical areas with two horizontal lines each; lower right: three trees of varying heights each flanked by taller rectangular boxes, the number 4 encircled on the right.",
    "justification":"The five drawings presented by the celebrated Italian post-modernist architect Andrea Branzi, are all connected to an exhibition entitled Trees &amp; Stones, displayed at the Friedman Benda Gallery from September 11 to October 13, 2012.&amp;nbsp; As one of the architects emerging in the 1960s and 1970s, who were looking for an alternative to modernist design and architecture, Branzi has sought to reconcile architecture and design with the factors of contemporary life.&amp;nbsp; He was one of the first architects to comment on the dichotomy of the natural and artificial worlds, on the over-saturation of mass production and the issue of limited supply of resources.\nIn his Trees &amp; Stones exhibition, Branzi produced furniture that brings the natural world into the living environment.&amp;nbsp; One D3 series bookshelves combines parts of birch trees with grid like metal and wood shelves and frames.&amp;nbsp; To document this series there is one presentation drawing showing four vertical book cases set against a back frame with 3 birch tree branches running vertically in between them.&amp;nbsp; The spaces between the cases is wide enough to give breadth and independence to the birch trunk elements rising a bit higher than the cases, creating a balance and harmony to Branzi\u2019s unique creations.&amp;nbsp; Two graphite drawings contain alternative preparatory sketches for this D3 Trees bookcase.&amp;nbsp; \nAnother design is the D11 Trees series.&amp;nbsp; The presentation drawing for this display unit shows four orange tree trucks of differing heights with alternating black disks, presumably to hold objects, grafted on to them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Here again, Branzi is playing with the idea of the natural and technological worlds brought together in the daily urban environment which can be quite estranged from nature. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To illustrate the design process, a graphite drawing has been selected with various shelving designs on it including one with tree trunks and disks emerging from them.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",
