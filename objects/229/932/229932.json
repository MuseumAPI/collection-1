  "description": "This drawing room, typical of the early Victorian period, shows the intimate comfort of a well lived-in room.  The ladies of the house are about their pursuits; the gentleman attends his dog.  Pictures line the walls, and a piano, a large round center table, a vase of flowers, a bird in its cage, a curious stuffed leopard, and shelves of books create an atmosphere of quiet relaxation. Books hanging on the door of the room are a seldom-depicted feature.",
