    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;One of England\u2019s leading contemporary goldsmiths, Kevin Coates's&amp;nbsp; training as a goldsmith began at London\u2019s Central School of Art, and he received his MA from the Royal College of Art in 1976. He has become known for his technical virtuosity and his symbolic imagery, which draws from mythology, folklore, mathematics, and music (he is also a noted musician and musicologist.&amp;nbsp; In 2007, his series, \u201cA Notebook of Pins,\u201d was exhibited at the Wallace Collection, which named Coates its Associate Artist. The series was exhibited by Mobilia Gallery at the 2008 SOFA-New York exposition.\n&quot;The Weighing Of The Heart&quot; brooch was inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a guide to the soul\u2019s journey through the Underworld. Coates said, \u201cThe Anubis amulet which forms the center of my \u2018page,\u2019 however, has lost both its hands and feet, but retained, despite its small scale, [a sense] of hieratic monumentality. I was able to recreate the deficient parts in gold, and by creating a divided field of shadow and light (ebony and carnelian), to install them as part of the judgment in which the heart is weighed against a feather (symbol of Maat, justice and Divine Order).\u201d Coates carried the theme and imagery into the slate mount he created for the brooch, making it a thought provoking object of adornment to wear on one\u2019s body or to display in an interior. Coates is a highly skilled goldsmith who approaches a range of materials with a successful mix of technical skill and an interpretive component not often present in jewelry design.&quot;",
