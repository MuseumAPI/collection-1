    "gallery_text": "Long before inexpensive electronic calculators, Japanese merchants used sticks to track the results of routine calculations. By 1800, a simple calculating device known as the abacus was adopted from the Chinese. An abacus consists of a series of equally spaced rods, each representing a single digit, set in a rectangular frame with beads that slide along each column. A horizontal bar divides the columns: the upper section represents fives, the lower section, ones. To add, one moves beads toward the crossbar, while to subtract, one moves beads outward. Different from the Chinese abacus, this Japanese soroban features distinctive biconical beads, which were easier to manipulate. Wood and bamboo, as in this example, were used extensively before World War II, but today\u2019s abaci are often made from molded plastic.",
    "label_text": "An abacus, a calculator, and a slide rule answer the question HOW MUCH? by means of very different techniques. The construction\nof some of our greatest modern buildings was calculated using slide rules. For surveying complex sites and surfaces, 3D laser scanners achieve such high precision that the interior of an entire building can be represented in minute detail.",
