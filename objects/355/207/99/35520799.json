    "justification": "Eighteen drawings by the artist Forrest Myers (b. 1941) are being offered as a gift to Cooper-Hewitt from Marc Benda of Friedman Benda Gallery.&amp;nbsp; These are divided into two groups: &amp;nbsp;nine designs for tables and nine for chairs.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Though primarily a sculptor of anodized wire pieces, Myers maintains that he has long been interested in the connection of sculpture and furniture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This area of exploration led him to create a stool in 1964, called Tendu, which leaned to one side.&amp;nbsp; He returned to furniture around 1980 when he designed the Cut-Out Chair and Fold Chair which led to his first solo exhibition at&amp;nbsp;New York's&amp;nbsp;Art et Industrie Gallery in 1981.&amp;nbsp; The eighteen sketches most likely date from this time because of their similarity to tables and chairs that were shown in the 1981 exhibition. &amp;nbsp;The sketches for chairs show nine different concepts, each made of one piece of folded aluminum&amp;nbsp;thereby eliminating&amp;nbsp;any soldering of separate elements.&amp;nbsp; The nine concepts for tables represent different ideas for round, rectangular, and oval tables with various aluminum-formed bases.",
