    "description": "Form composed of two gently twisting, contoured aluminum strips, each with thin grey rubber strip running vertically along center; raised circular black base. Upper aluminum strip, or arm, with large LED panel; arm pivots from horizontal to vertical positions at joint with J-curved, lower strip; base has small white circular on\/off button with manufacturer's logo in black; two curved, tapering 'troughs' for touch controls. Lamp swivels on base.",
    "justification": "Yves B\u00e9har, a Swiss-Turkish designer, was the 2004 National Design Award winner in the category of Product Design. Based in San Francisco, B\u00e9har and his firm, fuseproject, have rapidly become recognized for blending design and brand development and for designing objects based on a conceptual narrative inspired by the user\u2019s experience. B\u00e9har\u2019s body of work spans products from footwear, such the Footprints line for Birkenstock (2003), to high tech gear like the award-winning Aliph Jawbone noise-reduction cell phone headset (2004). \nThe Leaf task light was created primarily for the consumer market. Herman Miller, inspired by B\u00e9har\u2019s belief that a user\u2019s emotional connection to a product is essential to design, approached him to collaborate on the development of a new lighting concept. Other designers who have worked with Herman Miller include Gilbert Rohde, Charles and Ray Eames, and George Nelson. Although Herman Miller is now primarily known for office furniture systems, many of their consumer designs, like the Eames lounge chair, have become modern classics. Prior to the collaboration with B\u00e9har, Herman Miller\u2019s last consumer lighting design was Nelson\u2019s Bubble lamp range, introduced in 1952. Leaf is an effort to revive consumer lighting with 21st-century concerns in mind: socially responsible design, ease of use for a broad range of users, environmental sustainability, and energy conservation.\nB\u00e9har and Herman Miller product development team leader, Marc Gierz, first experimented with fluorescent, halogen, and cold cathode light sources before trying chip-based Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology. Early LEDs were red but, by 2004, chip makers had broadened the light color spectrum to produce a range from cool white to warm white. Working with Nichia Corporation, the Japanese company that invented LED technology, B\u00e9har and the Herman Miller team further developed the technology and devised the LED unit used in Leaf. \nThe grid of LEDs sits on the underside of one of two thin, curving, leaf-like aluminum blades. The sculptural metal form is designed to minimize use of material and mechanical complexity. The blades are hinged, allowing the top blade with the LEDs to pivot so the user can position the lamp up for direct light or down for ambient light. The innovative LED unit consumes less than 12 watts of electricity, has a lifespan of over 60,000 hours at full power, and reduces energy use by 40% compared with compact fluorescent lights. To reduce the intense heat produced by LEDs, B\u00e9har came up with another innovation: small \u201cchimneys\u201d above the chips that dissipate heat and keep the lamp cool.\nThe low, smooth, circular base houses complex circuitry that the user controls by touch. The user modulates light intensity and temperature simply by sliding a finger along the two curved, tapering troughs. The on\/off control is a small touch-sensitive circle. By varying both light temperature and intensity, the user can simulate the soft yellow glow of candlelight or choose a more intense incandescent- or fluorescent-like light appropriate for tasks such as sewing, reading, or working at a computer.\nLeaf would be the first example of 21st-century lighting in the collection and the first example of B\u00e9har\u2019s product design in the collection. It would also be an excellent addition to the museum\u2019s Herman Miller holdings that, at the time of proposed acquisition, include about a dozen examples of furniture, primarily by the Eames, and the innovative Aeron chair (1994).",
    "gallery_text": "Furniture manufacturer Herman Miller partnered with Yves Behar\u2019s studio, fuseproject, to create the company\u2019s first consumer desk lamp since George Nelson\u2019s Bubble lamp range, introduced in 1952. The Leaf Light task lamp uses a grid of light emitting diodes (LEDs) that rests along two thin, curving, leaf-like aluminum blades. The hinged blades pivot so the user can reposition the lamp to modulate direct or ambient light. Innovative and efficient, the unit offers 40% less energy expenditure compared with a compact fluorescent light. Leaf Light illustrates Behar\u2019s belief that design must produce products that are environmentally sustainable and provide values of social good, while still being attractive, functional, and commercially saleable.",
