The clustered objects are balanced by the large expanse of brown wall behind, and the simply rendered geometric furniture molding below.  Title of original drawing is at bottom of image.  Below image at lower left text and logo for Mobil and at lower center across the sheet in black block letters:  America: The Third Century",
