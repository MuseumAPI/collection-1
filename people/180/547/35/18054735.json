    "biography": "Christian Friedrich Herold was a German porcelain and enamel painter, who first worked in Berlin decorating enamel boxes for the Fromery factory. He subsequently moved to the  Meissen Porcelain factory, (1725-1777)  where he painted Chinoiserie and Harbor scenes. He may have continued to work with enamelled boxes, and may have acquired blank porcelain that he decorated out of his own studio later in his career.",
