  "description": "The style of this small but elegantly decorated bedroom is a reaction to the ornate, gilded and ormolu-encrusted taste of the Empire period. Pale gray paneled walls and polished floorboards create a subdued background. Windows are hung with white muslin curtains, the swags trimmed with tassels. A simple blue needlepoint rug is placed on the floor in front of a blue velvet settee. A tall, six-drawer chest with a white marble top, a small cylindrical bedside table and a corner dressing table-with-mirror reflect the new concept of design in the Restoration period in France.",
