  "description": "In the present black-and-white photograph, two cylindrical containers are placed on a textured background. (The actual color scheme is composed of dark green and gilt for the backgrounds and white for the type.) The larger container is positioned on the right, slightly behind the left-hand one. The identical product labels are imprinted Golden/ Blossom/ Honey in serif-style capitals on the dark background. One line of type in small capitals, stating the weight, appears above the product name. A partial view of the additional labeling in a hand-lettered style italicized type is imprinted close to the bottom edge, followed underneath by a line of type in small capitals.",
