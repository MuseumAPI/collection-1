    "description": "Fragment of woven silk with large tangent roundels. Each roundel contains a symmetrical design of a bearded man strangling a lion in each arm. A small animal is under each lion's feet and a pair of small birds appear between the strangler's feet. The roundel frame consists of confronted griffons with pearl guard bands. \nThe ornament in the interspaces consists of three concentric 8-pointed stars surrounded by eight radiating plant forms (pointed decorative trees alternating with scrolls terminating in palmettes). \nAt the bottom of the piece, a horizontal band of ornamented Kufic script repeats (upside down) written normally and in reverse with guilloche guard bands. \nIn dark green and crimson on cream ground fading into yellow in some areas. Face, hands, feet, belt disks of lion strangler, and heads of lions are brocaded with cream silk wound with gilded vellum.",
