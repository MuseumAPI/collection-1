    "justification": "This pewter ladle is designed and made by Shirley Charron. Its organic, ergonomic form represents the use of a handcrafted historical material in a modern design. Rather using a mold, Charron makes the object from sheet metal, cutting out the basic shape and then hammering and working it into a three-dimensional form. Each piece is unique. \nInitially trained as an artist at the Massachusetts College of Art, Charron began producing pewter work in 1966, training under the pewter smith Frances Felton, in consultation with whom she wrote the authoritative work, Modern Pewter: Designs and Techniques, in 1973. Charron developed the ladle form in the late 1970s and early 1980s and it was picked up by the luxury manufacturer and retailer, Cartier. Despite the ladle\u2019s popularity, Cartier eventually discontinued its line of modern pewter in favor of reproduction wares reflecting styles of earlier periods. Charron continued to produce the form, selling it privately. The object proposed for acquisition is one of Charron\u2019s privately produced ladles and represents a highly successful integration of form and function.",
