    "text": "\u201cMeier 75,\u201d includes drawings and models for three major projects\u2014the Smith House in Darien, Conn.; the Getty Center; and the Jubilee Church, in a suburb of Rome\u2014as well as three collage works by the architect Richard Meier. During a career spanning more than 50 years, Meier has placed his unique stamp on every type of architectural project, including private residences and housing complexes, corporate headquarters and commercial buildings, universities, seminaries, churches and museums. Inspired by the ideas and works of Le Corbusier and other early modernist architects, Meier sees a distinction between architecture and nature, viewing buildings as vessels through which one experiences the natural world. A highlight of the installation are two architectural drawings of the Getty Center, both of which are in the museum\u2019s Drawings, Prints and Graphic Design Department. A model of the Getty Center accompanies the drawings. The installation includes the collage works \u201cLibertas\u201d (1998), \u201cMax haus\u201d (1998) and \u201cArt\u201d (1987), which offers a unique view into Meier\u2019s architectural working process.",
