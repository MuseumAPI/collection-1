    "biography": "Flavor Paper was founded in New Orleans in 2004 but has since moved their headquarters to Brooklyn, New York. Many of Flavor Paper\u2019s designs are retro-inspired with an edge. They print on a variety of paper, Mylar and vinyl surfaces creating fun, wild and unique designs. There are two papers by Flavor Paper in the Museum\u2019s collection: City Park, a traditional damask format imbued with motifs of pigeons, fire hydrants and rats, and Cherry Forever, the first commercially produced scratch and sniff wallpaper. But I want to assure you, Shoes is not a scratch and sniff design, and there is no odor of worn shoes.",
