    "gallery_text": "Miniaturizing objects to a scale accessible to children has held a special fascination for designers and makers over the centuries. This child\u2019s tool chest declares carpentry to be boys\u2019 work, a commentary on early twentieth century society and its gender expecta\u00actions. Inside the lid is a color lithograph of boys building a small house beneath a banner that reads, BLISS UNION TOOL CHESTS FOR BOYS. R. Bliss & Company, originally a producer of wood screws and clamps for piano and cabinet makers, became well known for their lithographed wooden toys around the turn of the twentieth century. \nThe chest, complete with a hinged lid and a removable top tray, contains functional tools, including a metal plane, chisel, hammer, and saw. Only the size of the tools and the adjustments made to the grips for smaller hands distinguish the contents from their adult versions.",
