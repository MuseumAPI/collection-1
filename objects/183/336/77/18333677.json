    "description": "Prefericulum shaped, and suspended by four chains from an inverted bowl. The chains return, and support a round ring which hangs, centered to the main body of the lamp and about ten inches above it. The main body of the lamp is unadorned save for two fillets, a rolled, splayed rim and a ring which is attached to the lowermost point of the lamp. The inverted bowl is decorated by a torus and surmounted by a ring. Four handles in wrought scroll shapes act as brackets for the four suspension chains. The links of the chains are wrought in forms of bucklers, Maltese crosses (eight-point crosses), clefs, rampant lions, each connected by small eight-shaped links.",
