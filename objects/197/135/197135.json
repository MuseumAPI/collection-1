  "description": "Recto: The postcard, held horizontally, features an image of a basket of fruit, centered side to side, reproduced from a Caravaggio painting. The woven basket, holding various fruits, such as an apple, lemon, and grapes, interspersed with leaves on branches, sits on a narrow brown band just above the bottom edge. The background is in muted peach tones.  Two incised narrow bands, representing a pair of chopsticks, placed diagonally, horizontally, and one above the other, the pointed ends at the left, puncture the contents of the basket. \r\nVerso: The incised chopsticks appear in reverse, with the pointed ends at the right. One line comprising the restaurant's name, address and telephone number, imprinted in small upper and lower case letters, is centered at the bottom edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
