Center: \"2\"; an enriched bead moulding, similar to \"1\"; an acanthus rosette is applied in the frieze. At right: horizontal lines of an unfinished design. Second row: \"3\"; a laurel moulding, similar to \"1\"; the frieze shows masks in horizontal ovoids between projecting panels with vases in the frieze. A twisted rope moulding is among the lower ones. \"4\"; an ovolo moulding, similar laurel festoons are suspended from nails. Circles are shown in the wedges, one with a rosette, the other with a child's head. Third row: \"5\"; an interlacement band and a moulding with leaves, respectively, similar to \"3\"; the frieze shows two interlaced undulated bands, framing beads and a rosette. \"6\"; a laurel moulding and a bead, similar to \"3\"; a festoon is supported by a bukranion and a mask; a rosette in a circle is in the wedge. \"7\"; with flutes and a bead moulding. Bottom row: \"8\"; interlaced and undulated bands, similar to \"1\"; a spherical octagon with a rosette is flanked by circles, the left one of which shows a rosette, in the frieze. \"9\"; a leaf at left of the designs. Figure numbers are inscribed with pen and ink at left of the designs. Verso: pen and ink inscription of price list. Part of the last line is written over a graphite sketch of an Atlas gaine, in opposite direction. It is flanked at right by a crouching centaur. His left hind leg touches the corresponding leg of a symmetrically disposed other centaur, who is not entirely shown. The dome of a pavilion is shown in the middle over the centaur group.",
