  "description": "This interior view, clearly dificient in perspective, may have been painted by a Prussian cavalry officer. The trappings of an army officer - green and red military jacket hung over a chair back, plumed helmet, sword belt, three swords - indicate an officer's quarters. Pale wood furniture in the practical Biedermeier style, trellis-patterned wallpaper and simple white curtains create a quiet environment for sleep and study. Further details include a book-lined desk, a zither placed on the skirted table in front of the sofa and fencing gear hung on the fire screen next to the large black iron stove.",
