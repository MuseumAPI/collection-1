    "description": "Strips of coiled newsprint are woven with nylon filaments on handlooms in the manner of grasscloth. Made from 100% recycled newsprint.",
    "justification": "&quot;Newsworthy&quot; combines age-old techniques with the modern notion of recycling. Woven on handlooms using the same technique as traditional grasscloth, the wallpaper is composed of 100% recycled newspaper and nylon filament.\nThe bulk of the world's grasscloth has always been made in Japan. Traditionally woven from the bark of the honeysuckle vine, the use of grasscloth&amp;nbsp;as a wallcovering dates back hundreds of years where evidence of its use is found in ancient temples. The many stages of production slowly became standardized, and some mechanized, after Japan was introduced to Western markets. Grasscloth was first exported to the United States in the 1880s.\n&quot;Newsworthy&quot; is woven in India on traditional handlooms using the coiled newsprint for the weft and nylon filaments as the warp. This gives the paper strength and keeps it flexible. After the paper is woven, it is shipped back to the United States where it is paper backed to facilitate being pasted to the wall. As with grasscloth, slight variations in color are inherent in the product. The finished product does not receive any additional surface treatment. ",
