  "description": "An octagonal basin upon a square platform from which a shaft rises at center supporting a circular basin and two tiers adorned with statues depicting episodes of the Hercules legend. At the top of the shaft, Hercules supports the world.  On top pier, Hercules is shown with the Cretan Bull (at right side); Hercules with Hydra and the Nemean Lion (at left side).  Below them, on the rim of the circular basin (at mid-section of fountain), at each side, are two pairs of putti on Capricorns; the infant Hercules with a snake is shown at the center of this circular basin rim.  On the rim of the bottom octagonal basin are three statue groups: Hercules killing Nessus (center); Hercules and Antaeus (at right); and Hercules about to club another  unidentified male (left).  The sides of the octagonal basin are adorned with relief panels, probably depicting additional scenes from the life of Hercules.",
