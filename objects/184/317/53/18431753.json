    "description": "Headcloth, tabby (imitating netting), with embroidery. In shape of square, except for a section on one corner. Pieced. Very open weave resembling netting with large square meshes; in fine what creped cotton. Design: stylized cat heads projecting from long double diagonals embroidered on to the meshes in the same white cotton, with a thicker cotton bunched and knotted here and there to indicate eyes and mouth. Warps and wefts both used double, with one of the wefts in each pair looping itself around each interlacing, then continuing in the same direction as before. This weft-action gives the look of netting.",
