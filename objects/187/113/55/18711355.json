    "justification":"London Toile (ca. 2006), produced by Timorous Beasites, is patterned after early 19th century copperplate printed \u201ctoiles\u201d, which often depicted picturesque scenes or points of interest around various cities. However, close inspection of the blue on white patterning of this textile reveals a very contemporary London skyline that includes the Swiss Re tower and the London Eye (or Millennium Wheel), along with contemporary social woes such as homelessness and street violence. This wonderful screen printed toile is an interesting comparison to 18th and 19th century copperplate prints in the collection. ",
