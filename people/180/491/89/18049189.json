    "biography": "Hungarian-born Mathieu Mat\u00e9got (1910\u20132001) moved to Paris in 1931 after completing his studies at the School of Applied Arts in Budapest.  Mat\u00e9got began his career as a set designer for theater.  Mat\u00e9got developed a passion for tapestry design while training with Jean Lur\u00e7at (1892\u20131966), a French artist known for ushering in a renaissance in tapestry design during the first half of the twentieth century.  Today, Mat\u00e9got is primarily recognized for his tapestries, which has overshadowed his successful career as a prolific interior and furniture designer in the 1950s. Mat\u00e9got employed a range of cutting-edge materials, including perforated sheet metal, brightly-colored Formica and enameled steel-rod supports, for use in his inventive modernist furniture creations, which included dining sets, side tables and beds. One of his most notable designs is for a three-legged \u201cNagasaki\u201d chair with a scooped oval perforated sheet metal seat set atop a tubular steel frame. His Japanese- and Scandinavian-inspired furnishings figured prominently in his interior designs, which display the light, slender and low-slung proportions popular during the years immediately following World War II.",
