  "description": "Recto: Occupying center space, with margins of about 20 cm (3/4 in.) top and bottom and 25 cm (1 1/8 in.) each side, is an image of a slice of iced three-layer cake on a round plate. A fork, holding a bite-size piece of cake, extends from the top of the slice on the right to the upper right-hand corner, where it is cut off in the handle area. The plate is decorated with a narrow black circle a short distance from the plate rim.\r\nBetween the rim and the bottom edge of the card, centered, July 14th is imprinted in black.\r\nVerso: In the message area on the left, separated from the addressee area by a vertical dotted line, an invitation to a Bastille Day celebration is imprinted, mostly in italics, with a few words entirely in capitals for emphasis. On the right, the stamp area is indicated by a rectangle outlined in black; within it is the message \"Let them/ eat cake\"/ M. Antoinette/ 1789.",
