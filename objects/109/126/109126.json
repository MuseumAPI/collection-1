  "description": "Dark blue twill ground embroidered with polychrome wools in coarse outline and filling-stitches. A central square is framed by an interlacing pattern, inside it a woman in a full skirt holding flower, the date 1772, and the initials K.I.D. In alternate corners an 8-pointed star or a stylized vase and flower appear. A large cipher appears on each short end; a floral scroll at the lower edge and diapered,  tear-shaped leaves at the upper edge.",
