  "description": "An arched framework with an incomplete family register. The top of the arch reads Keep Sacred the Memory Of.  The field within the arch is divided in three registers: the top, titled Ancestors, gives the birth and marriage dates of David Kelly and Amy Comstock; the middle register includes a tree with the names and dates of their children; and the lower register has a verse within a leafy border:\r\n\r\nReligion\r\nBeyond the narrow vale of time\r\nWhere bright celestial ages roll\r\nTo scenes eternal scenes sublime\r\nShe points the way and leads the soul\r\n\r\nFollowed by the inscription. A border of roses in an octagon framework terminating with rose sprays at upper corners gives the effect of a trellis.",
