    "biography": "De Wolfe is considered to have invented the profession of interior design. A socialite often referred to by her married name, Lady Mendl, she was known for her interiors and style in New York, Paris, and London. Her clients included Anne Vanderbilt, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and the Fricks. De Wolfe rejected the dark Victorian style, instead embracing light and fresh colors combined with elements of chinoiserie, comfort, and an 18th-century palette.",
