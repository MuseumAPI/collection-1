    "description": "Panel formed of eleven narrow strips, each 3 3\/4 inches wide, sewn together. Each strip is patterned by a 17 inch section of narrow blue and white stripes alternating with an equal length section of a wide blue stripes, decorated with small geometric brocaded shapes in bright colors. The strips are sewn together so that the whiter and darker areas form a checkerboard. Red stripe along one long edge. Warp fringed at both ends.",

    "gallery_text": "The dynamic checkerboard effect of this wrapper was created using the ikat technique. Before weaving, the warp yarns are tie-dyed in two contrasting stripe patterns\u2014one predominantly blue and the other predominantly white. The dyed yarns are then woven in a continuous narrow strip and further embellished with scattered, brightly colored, brocaded motifs. The strip is cut and the pieces sewn side-to-side, carefully aligning the pattern areas to create a checkerboard design. The transition between the blue and white squares has the blurred effect characteristic of the ikat technique. \nThis type of cloth has become associated with the Baule people. The complex ikat technique, however, is rarely used in Africa and was undoubtedly brought to the Baule by Dyula dyers, who had major trade routes throughout the region; many Dyula migrated to Ivory Coast during the 1950s and 60s. The single red border is also characteristic of Dyula weavers.[1] \n\n\n\n\n[1] Christine Giuntini, Conservator in the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, The Metropolitan Museum of Art; email message to author, November 24, 2014, regarding the unpublished research of Jerry Vogel.",
