    "biography": "Dutch designer J\u00f3lan van der Wiel explores the impact natural forces have on form, wielding the conditions under which an object takes shape. While studying at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, from which he graduated in 2011, van der Wiel developed and built the gravity machine for which he is most well known. The tool uses oppositional forces of gravity and magnetism to generate organic, armored forms made from a composite material of iron filings and plastic or ceramic. With the machine, van der Wiel creates tables and stools that sprout stalactites, fantastical architectural models, even dresses and shoes imbued with a primordial, prickly surface, made in collaboration with fashion designer Iris van Herpen. From his Amsterdam-based studio and workshop, van der Wiel continues to experiment with his gravity machine, pushing it to create ever-new challenging and elegant work.",
