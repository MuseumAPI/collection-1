    "description":"Two fabrics sewn together (one on the outside, one on the inside - each a loomed width) to form a circular band. The fabric on the outside is tapestry-woven band with four panels, each showing a full-face standing figure wearing a headdress on a red, green or black background. The drawing is in the Tiahuanaco style but lacks the expected precision. The fabric on the inside is a heavy single weft double-cloth patterned by brown and ivory panels of checkerboard.",
