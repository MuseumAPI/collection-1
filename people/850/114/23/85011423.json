Faceted spaces emerge from saturated colors and gilded planes. Working in Amsterdam as an independent designer, Niessen studied design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, graduating in 1996. Alongside professional clients that include museums and foundations, Niessen pursues collaborations, publications, and self-authored projects in the cultural realm.",
