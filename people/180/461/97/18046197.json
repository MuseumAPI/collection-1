Lowenstein & Sons as part of the Signature Fabrics collection. These designs were featured in the New York Times, the New York Post, and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, among other publications, in 1952 and 1953. There are currently two examples of Hull's work in the museum's collection: Textile, Gay Facade, 1952-1957 (1994-38-8) and Sidewall, Speckled Diamond, 1953 (1954-21-9).",
