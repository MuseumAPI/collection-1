    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Six examples of this chair were featured around a glass table in the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company's (PPG) model dining room at the 1939 New York World's Fair Glass Center's &quot;Glass in teh Home&quot; exhibition. At least one other example of the chiar--with stripe-patterned upholstery--was shown in a model bedroom in front of a dressing table. The chair is made of a slumped plate-glass frame; it originally had Fiberglas fabric. The original seats were a solid color, possibly white, cream, or another light shade.\n...The Great Depression forced many Americans to reimagine how they defined 'luxury,' as exotic woods and expensive fabrics became unaffordable. Manufacturers, like PPG, responded by creating new forms, encouraging Americans to graudally accept new materials and technology into their homes. New funirture often eliminated ornamentation and details to become purely functional, as seen in PPG's chair. New forms and proportions also encouraged informality and comfort in the home over formality and fussiness. Although plastics were in use here, PPG showed that it was possible to create simple, classical forms with more traditional materials (though not traditional in furniture), bridging modernity to the past. House and Garden included glass furniture and fabrics as one of the 'decorative prophecies that will shape our World of Tomorrow,' providing a color illustration. \nDue to the fragility of glass, the form proved unsuitable for production. Regardless, this chair remains significant as a piece of World's Fair material culture; a demonstration of the hope and optimism in glass as a material at the time; and as a representation of the work of PPG, one of the most significant glass manufacturers in American history.&quot;",
