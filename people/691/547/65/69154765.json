    "biography": "Sandra Backlund\u2019s knitwear has no comparison. Operating outside the fashion cycle, her voluminous, textural, and layered forms evoke both organic and cyborg origins to exaggerate and distort the body\u2019s silhouette. \u201cI mean to shape the idea of the body using clothes,\u201d she says. Her creations flow organically from the techniques and materials of knitting and crochet, much as her sculptural designs borrow from the avant-garde and from conceptual art. Backlund graduated from Beckmans College of Design in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2004, and subsequently established her eponymous company. In 2007, Backlund was the Grand Prix winner of the Festival International de Mode et de Photographie \u00e0 Hy\u00e8res.",
