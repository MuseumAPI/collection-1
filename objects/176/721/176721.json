Fowler \r\nMrs Minerva S. Fowler \r\nDied 13, 1832 \r\nThe memory of the just is blessed\r\nElizabeth Starr Fowler aged 9 years and 8 months \r\nflanked by weeping willow trees and a tomb.\r\n\r\nThe hymn reads:  \r\nLittle Pilgrim, young in years,\r\nHast thou not a hundred fears\r\nThus to enter life's new road\r\nNever but with danger trod?\r\nPaths arrayed in tempting bloom\r\nWill entice thy steps to come;\r\nBut, though every fragrance sweet\r\nCharm thy senses, shun the cheat.\r\nYes, kind friend, I know full well\r\nSin and sorrow in them dwell;\r\nNever shall my steps be led\r\nWhere the virtuous should not tread.\r\nI will choose me such a guide,\r\nThat I cannot step aside:\r\nLord, if thou wilt be my aid,\r\nAll those gay deceits shall fade.\r\n\r\nAn additional text appears at the bottom:\r\nWhen soon or late they reach that coast\r\nOer life's rough ocean driv's\r\nMay they rejoice no wand'rer lost\r\nA family in heaven",
