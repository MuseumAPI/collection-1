  "description": "A design for a wall.  The central panel (tapestry) features three Fates spinning the thread of life.  Above them, a putto holds a crowned monogram, which may contain the initials of the Chateau de Craon's owner, the Marquis d'Armaille. This decorative central panel is flanked by two draped windows, through which can be seen a romantic landscape with classical temples. Beneath the windows are circular medallions with lyres and torches. Below the tapestry and on the window frames are located carved ornaments.",
