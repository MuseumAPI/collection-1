    "justification": "Apeloig was first commissioned by the Association des biblioth\u00e9caires de France, the national organization of libraries, in 2006.&amp;nbsp; At the time, the theme of their annual conference was \u201cDemain La Bibliotheque.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Apeloig was asked to consider that the future of libraries might not lie solely in books.&amp;nbsp; To create his typography, Apeloig chose as his inspiration the modular furniture found in so many new libraries.&amp;nbsp; Apeloig\u2019s font, ABF, was thus composed of rectangles, parallelograms, and circular forms that when arranged in various combinations would signal not only letters and numbers, but also the variety of spaces one might find in a library--tables and chairs, bookcases, etc.&amp;nbsp; For this poster, designed for the ABF\u2019s 2009 annual conference on the use of architectural spaces, Apeloig created a variation of his original font, setting the white forms of the text against corresponding black boxes.&amp;nbsp; The new font further emphasizes the space of the library, dividing the space of the poster and its text into cubicle-like formations.&amp;nbsp; Apeloig\u2019s signature playful balance of text and space is underscored here by the blocks of vivid color that punctuate the surrounding white space of the poster.
