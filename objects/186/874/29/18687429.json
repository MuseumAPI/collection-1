    "description": "Woman's wrapper consisting of eight 5 1\/2 inch wide strips of handwoven cotton, sewn together to make a panel. The center field is divided into six squares separated by bands of H-shaped \"airplane\" motifs. Each square is patterned with incomplete diamonds with a dot in the center, radiating out from a center dot in a petal-like arrangement. The outer and lower borders  use the same motifs as the center field. The upper border (when worn, seen here on the left) has scattered white dots. The inner border (when worn) interlocking triangles.  With guard borders of narrow zigzags. Design is reserved in white on a dyed brownish-black ground.",

    "gallery_text": "This Keith Haring-like design, which almost seems to vibrate, is made by a deliberate process that belies the ostensible spontaneity and vitality of its motif. The white designs are actually reserved in the undyed cotton, while a mud dye is painted on to cover the background surface. \nIron-rich mud is collected from the deepest parts of streams and ponds, and fermented for a year, until it becomes black. The hand-woven cotton cloth is soaked in a solution made from the leaves of certain trees, which dyes the cloth bright yellow and also serves as a mordant that allows tannins in the mud to bind to the cotton. After the pattern is outlined with a stick or metal tool by a female artist, the entire background is carefully covered with a thick layer of mud. The meticulous application of mud is repeated at least twice to achieve a rich, dark color. Finally, the reserved outlined patterns of the design are painted with a bleaching agent to remove the yellow dye and make the fabric white again. \nThis wrapper combines the airplane design, a symbol of modernity, with the lizard\u2019s head, derived from a type of lizard used for medicinal purposes. The spotted upper border, which would not be seen when the wrapper is worn, refers to a string of white beads worn around the waist by young women\u2014a potent symbol of femininity and fertility. A wrapper like this one would be worn for significant events in a woman\u2019s life: excision, marriage, the birth of her children, and burial.",
