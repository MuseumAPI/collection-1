    "biography": "Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly referred to as the Bauhaus, was an art and crafts school in Germany. The Bauhaus was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919. During its existence between 1919 and 1933, the school occupied three locations in Germany: Weimar (1919-1925); Dessau (1925-1932); and Berlin (1932-1933). Gropius' Bauhaus Manifesto, published in April 1919, sought to unify art, craft, and technology, and revolutionize the way in which traditional art schools operated. The conclusion of the Manifesto read: \"Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come.\" Based upon this premise, the Bauhaus required all courses to be taught by a master craftsman and a fine artist in order to integrate the disciplines. The ultimate objective of the Bauhaus was to design and create objects that embodied ideals of good design, and that could be mass produced. The school produced ceramics, metalworks, furniture, and textiles. However, production on an industrial scale proved elusive, and the textiles workshop was the only one to generate sufficient production to sustain itself. The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, and Israel in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime.",
