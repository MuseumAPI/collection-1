  "description": "Design consists of a black circle centered on a sheet containing four three-dimensionally drawn boxes, positioned in a clockwise motion.  The negative area at center of the boxes creates a black four pointed, vertically oriented star.  The black lines of the front sides of the boxes are strongly delineated.  The secondary lines, or the back side of the boxes, have been overdrawn with gouache to suggest a three-dimensional illusion.",
