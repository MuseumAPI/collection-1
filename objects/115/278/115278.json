  "description": "Positioned on a long neck, a female head, inclining downward and leftward, is in the center of the page. Curly hair frames the face stops just below chin level; downcast eyes under straight brows, a straight nose, and full, closed lips comprise the facial features. Shading is prominent on the right side of the face and neck. A ruffled neckline completes the design. \r\n\r\nAn additional view, of a female in left profile, appears just above to the left. The features are similar to, but less detailed than, the frontal view, and shading is absent.\r\n\r\nAn ornament is situated to the right of the profile.",
