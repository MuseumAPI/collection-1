    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The Newton is among the early generation of personal digital assistants, or PDAs,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a type of hand-held computers, also called palmtop computers. The first PDA was produced by Casio in 1983, followed by examples from other manufacturers such as Acer, and later Blackberry and Palm. The term PDA was coined in 1992 by then-Apple CEO, John Sculley, when he was referring to the Newton at a consumer electronics show. \nA hallmark of Apple's design ethos has been its concern for objects that are comfortable, aesthetically appealing, and easy to use, both in terms of hardware and software. The Newton MessagePad exemplifies this approach: its light-weight tablet form features a large screen designed for ease of reading and entering data with the touch of a stylus, housed in a holder along the Newton's right side. Interaction is accomplished by tapping the screen to activate on-screen menu choices or buttons. Text was input using a virtual keyboard on the screen and tapping the letters. Like other PDAs it has email and fax capabilities, and a personal organizer (calendar, names, and to-do lists), but what set the Newton apart was an ambitious, innovative handwriting recognition technology. Using the stylus, the user could write directly on the screen and the Newton would learn to read the writing. &amp;nbsp;When newly released in 1993, the Newton was eagerly received. However, its launch may have been premature since the handwriting recognition software did not work as accurately as hoped. This was solved, resulting in the MessagePads which were produced for about five years. The line was discontinued in 1998, shortly after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs returned as CEO. The pioneering Newton technology laid the groundwork for some of Apples later innovations like the now ubiquitous iPhone introduced in 2007.&quot;",
