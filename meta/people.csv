"Born in 1861 in Tallmadge, Ohio, Clara Wolcott Driscoll was among the many young women who flocked to New York City in the late 1800s seeking respectable careers, particularly in the burgeoning field of industrial arts. After graduating from Cleveland's Western Reserve School of Design for Women in 1882, she attended the Metropolitan Museum Art School in New York City and was hired by Tiffany around 1888. In 1892 she was appointed head of the newly-formed Women's Glass Cutting Department, which eventually employed as many as thirty-five women. In addition to managing a large staff, Driscoll was responsible for creating designs for a wide range of objects and, in fact, designed most of the firm's lampshades and mosaic bases.

"Thomas Heatherwick:  Since founding the Heatherwick Studio in 1994, Thomas Heatherwick has garnered international recognition as one of the most influential and innovative designers today.  Heatherwick’s works span a wide range of disciplines—from architecture, furniture, fashion, and product design to engineering, transportation design, and urban planning—and are executed on a variety of scales.  Born in London in 1970, Heatherwick was introduced to design at an early age by both of his parents.  His mother, a bead collector, helped Heatherwick to develop his aesthetic while his father introduced him to architecture and design.  As a child, Heatherwick frequently worked on inventions, anything from mechanical birthday cards to go-karts. He went on to study 3-D design at Manchester Polytechnic, where he received a degree in 1991, followed by study in a two year Furniture MA program at the Royal Academy of Art, receiving a degree in 1994. Upon graduating, he established the Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now the Heatherwick Studio) where over the last 18 years, he and a group of fellow designers, architects, and engineers have worked on nearly 200 projects. Heatherwick has won various honors and awards, including honorary doctorates from four universities: Sheffield Hallam, Brighton, Dundee, and Manchester Metropolitan University.  Heatherwick is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and is a Senior Fellow at the Royal College of Art.  Additionally, he is the youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry.  His works have been exhibited in England and internationally, and most recently the V&A hosted a retrospective of the works of Heatherwick Studio called, “Heatherwick Studio: Designing the Extraordinary.”",1,"English, born 1970",,35459769,,,,,Thomas Heatherwick,,0,0,16942,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35459769/,,,,,23424975

"Philippe Apeloig (b. 1962) is a French graphic designer and typographer.  Apeloig was educated at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Appliqués and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, where he gained experience in what was then the traditional approach to typography—calligraphy, hand lettering, and metal type.  While still a student, he worked as a intern at the Dutch firm Total Design under the guidance of Daphne Ofreski and Yoleen van der Vouw.  Both Ofreski and van der Vouw were assistants to Total Design founder Wim Crouwel, and they imparted in Apeloig the value of the organizational grid that would become one of the foundations of his personal approach.  Following his graduation, Apeloig worked as a designer for Musée d’Orsay in Paris from 1985 to 1987 before traveling to Los Angeles to work with April Greiman.  Under Greiman’s mentorship, Apeloig was encouraged to embrace emerging technology as a design tool.  He returned to Paris to establish his own studio, and has since taught typography and graphic design at The Cooper Union School of Art in New York and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.  Since the late 1980s, Apeloig has produced poster designs and graphic identities for the New York Type Directors Club, FIAF (French Institute / Alliance Francaise) in New York, Instituto Universitario di Architectura di Venezia (IUAV), Musée du Louvre, Association des bibliothécaires de France (ABF), The New York Times T Magazine, the Châtelet Theatre Musical de Paris, Le Maison de Photo, Brittany, and Galerie Litvak, Tel Aviv, among others.

"Founded by English chemist, William J. Blenko as Eureka Art Glass Company, in Milton, West Virginia in 1921, the Blenko Glass Company assumed its name in 1930.  Blenko understood not only the glass process, but color, a key impact of glass design.  Initially, the firm specialized in plate glass, patenting a ruby red color that could be re-fired for stained glass enamellists.  Blenko introduced tableware in 1929; during the 1930’s it inclined towards a Swedish aesthetic, especially under foreman Carl Ebert Erickson from 1937-42.  In 1947, Blenko hired Winslow Anderson as its first credited full-time, in-house designer.  Anderson (1947-53) at Blenko was succeeded by Wayne Husted (1953-63), Joel Philipi Myers (1963-70), John Nickerson (1970-74), Don Shepherd (1974-88), Hank Adams (1988-94), Matt Carter (1995-2002), Richard Blenko (1980-2007), and Arlen Bayliss (2007-2012) as artistic directors.",7,"Milton, West Virginia, 1921 - 2012",,35459779,,,,,Blenko Glass Company,,0,0,16953,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35459779/,,,,,23424977

"The firm of Hemmerle, a fourth-generation family-run atelier based in Munich, Germany, is an innovative high-end jewelry firm with a distinctive approach to its choice of materials. It traces its origins to the late nineteenth century when, in 1893, brothers Joseph and Anton Hemmerle took ownership of an existing Munich jeweler Elchinger, changing the name to Gebruder (or brothers) Hemmerle in the process.  Munich has for centuries been a center of high-quality craftsmanship in gold, silver and jeweled work, a tradition from which Hemmerle emerged.  Hemmerle became renowned for offering traditional jewelry and decorations that were sufficiently technically sophisticated and of high quality and soon thereafter the firm was appointed purveyor to the Royal Bavarian Court.  In this capacity, the firm provided the royal family with military decorations and medals. In 1904, Hemmerle established its boutique and atelier on fashionable Maximilianstrasse in Munich, where it still stands today.

Joseph’s and Anton’s sons, Joseph Jr. and Carl Hemmerle, assumed directorship of the company in 1937 and continued producing the traditional jewels for which Hemmerle enjoyed a strong reputation. In 1971, directorship passed to their sons, Franz and Stefan, and in 1995, Stefan took sole control of Hemmerle with his wife Sylveli. Stefan, a trained goldsmith, became the creative design force behind the firm. He cites as inspirations the unusual mix of nature, the Bauhaus and the Neue Sachlichkeit movement. Under their direction, the firm underwent a major transformation, developing a bold and sometimes understated aesthetic that continues the use of high-quality stones with some surprising mixes of metals and even woods.

The transition started with a commission in 1995 for a prominent Munich art collector. In response to the client’s penchant for Berlin iron jewelry, Stefan Hemmerle set a large white diamond in a base of textured black iron rather than the predictable gold or platinum. The unusual, irreverent combination of a common metal with the brilliance of a precious stone against the textured iron mixed historical and contemporary aesthetic simplicity and bold modernity, becoming a Hemmerle signature. The company has since expanded beyond iron, employing unconventional, provocative materials such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, brass, rare woods, acorns, river pebbles, and even walrus teeth in creating its architectural settings for exquisitely cut gemstones. 

As of 2012, Stefan and Sylveli Hemmerle run the business with their son, Christian, and daughter-in-law, Egyptian-born Yasmin. Together the family oversees all aspects involved in Hemmerle’s designs. Production at their atelier is annually limited to no more than 350 pieces. A single piece can take up to 500 hours to create, and no two are exactly the same. Hemmerle can be called a haute joaillerie firm as it concentrates on high-quality craftsmanship and stones.  Their innovative techniques and material combinations along with an interest in a modernist aesthetic in design are not often associated with haute joaillerie, but it makes them a creative firm in this field.

"Peter Krider began his apprenticeship with Philadelphia silversmith John Curry in 1835 and finished it there with the more prolific and well-known firm of Robert and William Wilson, where he worked as a journeyman for about 15 months. In about 1842, he moved to Boston, where he worked for Obadiah Rich, returning to Philadephia about four years later to serve as the Wilsons' foreman. His firm, Krider & Co, appears in the Philadelphia directories first in 1851. He ultimately became one of Philadelphia's most important silversmiths of the second half of the nineteenth century.   During most of the time from  1859-1870 , when John W. Biddle was his partner, the firm was known as Krider & Biddle. The business was sold to August Weber in 1888.  
Krider specialized in beakers, and partnered with retailers in other parts of the country. However, he also made hollowware for prominent Philadelphia retailers such as Bailey and Company, and J. E.

"Fortunato Pio Castellani (1794-1865) was a Roman Antique dealer, jeweler and goldsmith who was the most significant influence on Victorian jewelry and is credited as the pioneer of the Greek and Etruscan classical revival in the early 1860s, better known as the archaeological revival style of jewelry.  This style was extremely popular in both Europe and America.  Fascinated by the jewels of antiquity, he studied the style and techniques of ancient Etruscan (western Tuscany) goldsmiths who had attained technical perfection during the 7th to 5th centuries BC.  The styles contained gold granulation and filigree and included decorative motifs such as rosettes, urns and amphora.

The Castellani family, Fortunato in collaboration iwth his two sons Allesandro and Augusto, was responsible for jewelry's return to antiquity and resulting archaeoligical revival style dominating the mid nineteenth century.

Castellani displayed his new creations at the world's Great Exhibitions:  Florence (1861), London (1867 & 1878), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876) and Turin (1884).

"Agostino Brunias, born in Italy, was in London exhibiting at the Society of Arts by 1763. He worked in London as a painter and engraver until commissioned to go to Dominica (the future Santo Domingo/Haiti) possibly by the British Colonial governor in about 1770.He remained there, dying in 1796.
 He painted large scenes of figures of blacks, mixed race and white plantation owners to servants, in various types of clothing in landscapes. Some of these were sent back to England and displayed in exhibitions at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. He also produced engravings of similar scenes while there. Six of the set of eighteen buttons stated to have been owned by Toussaint L'Ouverture, in the Museum's collection are the same subjects as six engravings by Brunias.",18,"Italian, ca. 1730–1796",,18537399,,,,,Agostino Brunias,,0,0,8840,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537399/,,,,32170070,

Along with her husband William, she was an avid collector of American Art Pottery. She and her husband William purchased their first piece of pottery in 1968 at an auction in upstate New York. The Samuel Weller ceramic pedastal was the beginning of their diverse collection, which contained a number of Rookwood and Tiffany pieces. She moved from New York, her longtime home, to San Diego in 1993. She died in 2004, survived by her children Emily Evans, Amy Goodman Kiefer, and Michael Goodman.

"Helen Kramer is best known for her handwoven drapery and upholstery. In the 1930s, she attended the Traphagen School of Design in New York, studying costume design. She traveled through Europe where she studied handweaving and fabric design. She liked to experiment with color. Kramer opened a showroom on Madison Avenue in New York, and then she and her brother, Boris, began working together under the brand name, Cromwell. During the early 1940s, she accompanied her husband, a doctor, to the Ashford General Hospital, where she launched a training program for occupational therapists to teach weaving. After the war, she opened a studio on Lexington Avenue.",350,"American, 1907–1977",,18535597,,,,,Helen Kroll Kramer,,0,0,8075,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18535597/,,,,,23424977

"Carlo Scarpa was born in Venice in 1906, and lived in the Veneto for most of his life, until his death in 1978 at the age of 72. In 1919, he enrolled in the fine arts academy, simultaneously gaining work experience in local planning offices. He received his diploma and first personal commission the same year, in 1925; the latter was for Giacomo Cappellin, to restore the Palazzo da Mula in Murano, which housed Cappellin’s glassmaking company’s administrative offices. The work introduced him to glassmaking, and the following year he started to design glasswares for the company, MVM Cappellin, doing so until it closed in 1932. That year, he went to Venini, for whom he designed for fifteen years, serving as an artistic director.

As an architect, he designed both major and minor works, almost exclusively in the Veneto region—though his influence and ideas reached around the world. Some of his major works include the Villa Zoppas (1948-53), Olivetti Showroom (1957), the Casa Veritti (1957-61), the Querini Stampalia Foundation (1961-63), the Museo Corner (1957-60), Brion-Vega Cemetery (1970-72), and Villa Ottolenghi (1974-79), among numerous others. 

Scarpa received many awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including the Diploma of Honor for glass objects at the Milan Triennale (1940), Olivetti National Prize for Architecture (1956), IN-ARCH National prize and gold medal from the Ministry of Education for his work at Verona’s Castelvecchio Museum (1962), President of the Republic’s Prize for Architecture (1967), and the honoris causa degree in architecture (1978). In addition to designing and planning various exhibitions, his own work was also shown in many, including the Venice Biennales, Milan Triannales, and New York MoMA’s 1967 architecture show. He was appointed director of the Venice Institute of Architecture in 1972.

"John Henry Belter (1804-1863) was a German-American cabinet maker. The John Henry Belter and Company Cabinet Factory was founded in 1858 on East 76th Street at 3rd Avenue in New York. The business opened in 1849 and closed in 1867. Because of the small size of his workshop, Belter is also considered the manufacturer of all of his furniture.
Influenced by the designs of John Jelliff (1813-1893), cabinetmakers (worked primarily with hand-crafted chair and sofa crests); archives at the Newark Museum. Belter's choice of rosewood for his chairs has been attributed to the Biedermeier period.",2,"American, b.

"Father of Piero Zen, Italian furniture designer, Carlo Zen was active in Milan, Italy.  He was both an Italian cabinetmaker and the owner of the largest furniture workshop in turn of the century Milan.  Zen was known for his furniture produced in ""Stilo Floreale,"" a combination of Art Noveau, Symbolist, and eclectic motifs.  Although he was a factory manager and not a designer per se, his firm was associated with the Haas of Vienna, thus adopting similar asymmetrical patterns and later geometric forms in furniture design.  The most renowned work of his factory was exhibited at the 1902 Exhibition of International Decorative Arts in Turin, Italy.",2,1851–1918,/m/02v_jff,18537909,,,,6559,Carlo Zen,,0,0,9054,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537909/,,,,12330197,23424853

"Born in Switzerland in 1908, Erik Nitsche was a graphic designer known for his innovative work in book design, illustration, and typography.   Nitsche studied at the Collège Classique in Switzerland and the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich before immigrating to the United States in 1934. He designed a number of covers for avant-garde and multilingual cultural publications in Europe as well as illustrations and covers for major American magazines such as Life, Town and Country, Harper’s Bazaar and Vanity Fair.  Nitsche also developed advertising and promotional campaigns for the cinema giant Twentieth Century Fox and the New York Transit Authority, and produced more than 200 album covers for Decca Records.  Nitsche may be best known for his historic relationship with General Dynamics, whose innovative graphic identity and information graphics he produced in the 1950s. He  was also responsible for more than 2,000 color illustrations reproduced in the five-volume encyclopedia L’Épopée Nationale d’un Siècle.  Nitsche continued to work actively in design until his death in 1998.",1,"Swiss, 1908 - 1998",,18538331,,,,,Erik Nitsche,,0,0,9235,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18538331/,,,,,23424957

"Producer of clothing and fragrances. Lucien Lelong was born in Paris in 1889. His father was a dressmaker, and Lelong followed in his footsteps, establishing his own fashion business in the World War I era. By the 1920s and 1930s he was well-known as a fashion designer, and in 1926 established Parfums Lelong. In 1934 he introduced his ready-to-wear line, which supplemented his couture business. He became the president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture. After being forced to shut down during the second World War, business reopened in 1941. Lelong hired Dior and Balmain as designers, and retired in 1947. The company produced no less than 17 fragrances.

"Hideko Takahashi (b.1950) is part of a younger generation of Japanese designers working within what now could be considered a tradition of Japanese experimentation with textile forms and surfaces. Educated at the Otsuka Textile Design Institute, Takahashi has also studied and apprenticed with Junichi Arai, one of the pre-eminent textile designers of the last twenty years. She learned from Arai the importance of combining both the hand and advanced technology in textile design and production. Takahashi has focused her investigations and experimentations primarily in the medium of wool fiber and has transformed two-dimensional planes of wool into three-dimensional sculptural surfaces.",1,,/m/027jchd,18539241,,,,,Hideko Takahashi,,0,0,9636,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18539241/,,,,8777224,23424856

"Coray was born in Wald, Switzerland on June 9, 1906, and died in Zurich on November 22, 1991. A pioneer of industrial design, his work is admired for its simplicity and functionality. He was a sculptor, primarily in metal, as well as a painter, and held a doctorate in Romance language and literature. He was part of a creative circle that included Max Bill and Anton Stankowski. His other designs include upholstered and wire seating and, in the 1950s, aluminum chairs and tables for Wohnbedarf (a progressive high-design shop founded in 1931). In connection with the 1939 Swiss National Exhibition, he also worked on the interiors of several pavilions (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",2,"Swiss, 1906 – 1991",/m/0bvlpb,18538415,,,,8062,Hans Coray,,0,0,9274,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18538415/,,,,4294295,23424957

"Serge Chermayeff was born in the Caucasus in 1900 and recieved his education in England. Much of his early architectural work is there. He taught at the European Mediterranean Academy in Cavalière, France in the early 1930s. In 1939 he came to the US to accept a post at the San Francisco Art Institute and Brooklyn College while pursuing private practice. At Brooklyn College he was chairman of the design department from 1942-1946. He was later on the faculty of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Insititute of Technology.  In 1953 he accepted a position as head of the department of architecture at Harvard. From 1962-1970 he served as head of the architecture department at Yale. 
Among the noted buildings he designed are: the seaside Bexhill Pavillon in England; the Clarence Mayhew House in Oakland and the Horn House in Marin County, CA.
He was the author, with C. Alexander, of ""Community and Privacy: Toward a New Architecture of Humanism""(1963) and with Alexander Tzonis, of ""Shape of Community: Realization of Human Potential"" (1971).
He was the co-founder of the American Society of Planners and Architects. He also served as president, on recommendation of Gropius, of the Chicago Institute of Design.
He died at age 95 in Wellfleet, MA in 1996.",13,"American, b. Grozny, Chechnya  1900–1996",/m/09dgqj,18536373,611075,,,,Serge Ivan Chermayeff,,0,0,8402,500011342,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18536373/,11415,46808185,,3457421,23424977

"Wilson is responsible for taking needlework, a traditional form of art, to an international audience. She trained at the Royal School of Needlework in London. Wilson was invited to travel to Millbrook, NY by someone interested in establishing a school of needlework. She taught at the Cooper Union and held workshops in her apartment, eventually teaching thousands of students. This led to her writing books, columns and hosting a television program. Wilson is considered the mother of the rebirth of needlework in the United States. She was married to furniture designer, Vladimir Kagan.",1,"American, b.

"Industrial designer, design educator and author, Naoto Fukasawa, believes that design should be intuitive and seamlessly engaging to those who experience it. One of Japan's most influential contemporary designers, he is noted for creating designs that are both functionally and conceptually sound. ""Fukasawa's  innovative designs of familiar objects are based on his close observations of how we use things in our everday lives. Rather than focusing on objects in isolation, he considers how they relate to their surroundings.”1  Born in 1956 in Yamanashi prefecture, Japan, Fukasawa graduated from Tama Art University in 1980. He designs objects that are, as he describes, 'close to the body.' He thinks that design should be a part of the human experience, and the story of how an object comes to be is as important as the final design. After spending eight years as the head of the American design firm IDEO's Tokyo office, he established Naoto Fukasawa Design in 2003. That same year, he helped start the Plus Minus Zero brand of household and electronics products. Fukasawa has received more than 40 international awards, and his work is included in the permanent collections of museums throughout the world. He is currently a professor at Musashino Art University and a visiting lecturer at Tama Art University.

"Born in Long Beach, California, metalworker Forrest Myers studied at the San Francisco Art Institute where he was inspired by the wire sculpture of Alexander Calder as well as the jazz of Ornette Coleman. He moved to New York in 1961 and joined a number of innovative artists and sculptors (all graduates of the San Francisco Art Institute), including Mark di Suvero, Robert Grosvenor, Ed Ruda and others, in forming the artists’ cooperative The Park Place Gallery.  When Park Place disbanded in 1967, Myers showed his work at the newly formed Paula Cooper Gallery.  In 1968, he became a member of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a group founded as a laboratory for creative experimentation by the engineers Fred Waldhauer and Billy Kluver with artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Witman.  Myers was among four members of E.A.T. commissioned to design the Pepsi Cola Pavilion and program at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan, considered among the most important and influential installations combining art and technologiy of the twentieth century.  Myers’ most famous work is The Wall, commissioned in 1973 by the public art organization City Walls (now known as Public Art Fund).  The 75 x 100 foot teal blue-painted wall, with projecting green-painted aluminum beams set in a grid pattern, was mounted on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway and became a SoHo icon.  Forrest Myers’ sculptures are in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, Storm King Art Center, and the Virginia Museum of Art, Richmond, VA.",18,"American, b. 1941",,35518601,,,,,Forrest Myers,,0,0,17179,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518601/,,,,,23424977

"Born in Ferrara, Italy in 1951, Michele de Lucchi studied architecture at the University of Florence, from which he graduated in 1975.  Among a group of architects and designers working in the 1970s and 1980s who were reacting against the “stifling” formalism of the prevailing International Style, Michele de Lucchi joined several radical experimental design groups including Gruppo Cavart and Studio Alchymia, before becoming one of the founding members of the infamous design collective, Memphis, led by Ettore Sottsass.  From 1992 to 2002, Michele de Lucchi was design director for Olivetti and developed experimental projects for such corporate clients as Siemens, Phillips, Compaq Computers, and Vitra.   His product designs for Artemide (Tolomeo and Logico lamp series), Kartell, Matsushita, and Cucine are still celebrated today.  Michele de Lucchi’s architectural commissions include exteriors and interiors for Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Telecom Italia, the Groningen Museum in the Netherlands and the Neues Museum in Berlin.  As an advocate for artisanal production techniques and materials, Michele de Lucchi founded Produzione Privata in 1990 to produce his product designs and works on architecture commissions through his studio aMDL, based in Milan and Rome.",2,"Italian, b. 1951",,35518609,,,,,Michele de Lucchi,,0,0,17183,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518609/,,,,,23424853

"Andrea Branzi is an architect, designer, and professor of industrial design, working in the fields of urban planning and cultural promotion. In 1966 Branzi founded the Archizoom Association with partners Paolo Deganello, Gilberto Corretti and Massimo Morozzi. The firm, named after the British group of architects known as Archigram and the journal “Zoom,” was one of the first avant-garde groups associated with the Postmodernist movement in Italy. From its founding until 1974, the team produced work in design, architecture and urban planning that aimed reconciliation between design and the challenges of contemporary society.  Branzi and its members developed plans such as No-Stop City (1970), a radical design vision projecting the city of the future as a “fluid metropolis,” where the individual can creatively and freely achieve his own housing conditions. Archizoom also invented “Superarchitecture,” endorsing unconventional and eclectic design along the lines of Pop Art. In 1983 Branzi cofounded Domus Academy, the first international post-graduate school for design.   He is the author of many books and essays on the theory and history of design, and has collaborated with magazines such as Domus, Interni and Casabella.  His work has been featured in the Venice Biennale and Milan Triennale, and is in the permanent collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among others.",5,"Italian, b. 1938",,35518605,,,,,Andrea Branzi,,0,0,17181,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518605/,,,,,23424853

"Byung-Hoon Choi is a pioneer of sculptural art furniture design in his native Korea.  Choi strives to create works of design that transcend the traditional boundaries of functionality, while simultaneously evoking Korean cultural symbols.  He was one of several artist/designers who promoted a modern approach to traditional Korean furniture in the second half of the 20th century.  Choi often uses seemingly contradictory shapes or materials in a single design, but he employs stone, a signature element, to establish a unity and tranquility within each work.  His designs are often derived from nature, incorporating the natural world through both material and form.  His work is included in the collections of a number of institutions in South Korea, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul and the Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as in the Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany.",1,"Korean, b. 1952",,35518607,,,,,Byung-Hoon Choi,,0,0,17182,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518607/,,,,,

"Originally founded in 1957 as Brownjohn, Chermayeff and Geismar, the ""Design Studio"" was strongly influenced by European Modern Art currents.  Characterized by a strong sense of form, their work exploits the vitality of repetition and texture. The firm distinguished itself in designs for album covers, graphic designs for books and plays and their inovative installation for the American Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  In 1960, Robert Brownjohn (1925-1970) left the firm.  Chermayeff & Geismar is known for their contribution to the corporate idenity movement with commissions from Chase Manhattan Bank and Mobil Corporation, for whom they designed logos, product design and advertising.",7,,,18053275,,,,,Chermayeff & Geismar Associates,,0,0,7371,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053275/,,,,,23424977

"Christ, as the artist prefers to be named, was born in Gabrovo,  Bulgaria in 1935. He studied at the Fine Arts Academy , Sofia, Bulgaria from 1952-56, the Burian Theater in Prague in 1956 and at the Fine Arts Academy in Viennia in 1957.  In 1960 he married Jeanne-Claude Guillebon with whom he collaborates on many of larger projects. 
In 1958 he began his first 'wrappings' often interpreted as a comentary on the packaging of experience in modern culture.  Ordinary objects are selected, sometimes randpomly, and wrapped in a variety of materials and secured with string, rope or tape.  In some cases, the wrapping changes the perception of the solidity, dimension and structure of the object.  
Christo is know for monumental projects undertaken in the late 1960s and continuing to the present. Among the best known are Wrapping the Reichstag Building in Berlin; The Valley Curtain Project, Colorado; and Running Fence, California.
Christo became a naturalized American citizen in 1973.",3,"American, b. Bulgaria 1935",,18053287,,,,,Christo,,0,0,7378,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053287/,11069,17231583,,,23424977

"She is a mathematician and adjunct professor at Cornell University. However, she is best known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space. In 1991, she received her doctorate from the University of Latvia in mathematics. After seeing a flimsy paper model of hyperbolic planes in a workshop in 1997, she made a durable option by crocheting a model. These crocheted models were presented in textbooks that she and her husband co-wrote.  Taimina’s models allowed for a more approachable method to understanding hyperbolic space and geometry. She gave workshops to children and adults. Additionally, she was invited to exhibit her crocheted objects in galleries and museums.",1,"Latvian, active U.S.A., b. 1954",/m/06_wwc,18064203,,,,,Daina Taimina,,0,0,16054,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064203/,,,,2272644,

"Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (1871–1949) began his career as a painter, etcher and sculptor, but early on developed an interest in all manner of design and decorative arts, creating textiles, fashions, lamps, furniture and interiors, as well as designs for the stage. Believing that the artist should control every detail of production, Fortuny also invented and patented his own processes and machinery, in areas as varied as photography, lighting design, and textile printing. Born in Madrid and raised in Paris, he eventually made Venice his home and established his business there. The textile mill has been in almost continuous operation since it began with the introduction of the Delphos dress in 1907 (The factory was closed briefly after Fortuny died in 1949). 

While Fortuny’s textile designs draw heavily on the woven silks of Renaissance Italy, he also traveled extensively and drew inspiration from Persian silks, Coptic Egyptian ornament, and classical Greek garment styles. Emulating the patterns, rich colors, and metallic sheen of these woven silks, Fortuny used silkscreen technology and his own patented dyeing and printing process, which involved natural dyes, discharge or bleaching agents, and metallic inks.",19,"Spanish, active Italy, 1871 - 1949",,18045993,,,,,Mariano Fortuny,,0,0,2907,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045993/,58475,66475439,,36839628,23424950

"Bush-Brown grew up on the Hudson, near Newburg, NY, and studied art at the Pratt Institute. She is best known for her tapestries, which were extremely popular during her lifetime.  She would combine stenciling, block-printing and embroidery on brightly colored silks, creating lovely mural silks, as she called them. Although she employed the batik technique of wax resist dyeing, she did not see her work as having traditional qualities. Her works were exhibited all over the United States, including the Pan-American Exhibition, the Ehrich Gallery, the Architectural League, the National Arts Club, and other venues. Bush-Brown’s process was to observe nature and then sketch her ideas, which were then transferred to the fabric with wax. She was inspired by her international travels, which included Mexico, Europe, and the Near East.",25,"American, 1887–1984",,18045909,,,,,Lydia Bush-Brown,,0,0,2859,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045909/,,,,,23424977

"Guimard was born in Lyon on March 10, 1867, and died in New York on May 20, 1942.  He attended the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs and then the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1882-5.  It appears that he was strongly influenced by Victor Horta’s Hôtel Tassel in Brussels.  Guimard’s Castel Béranger of 1898 made him famous and he received many commissions, including the entries into the stations of the Paris Metro.  His approach was one of design totality, and his buildings’ interior spaces, decorations and furnishings corresponded to the exterior appearance and structure.  The Castel Béranger and his 1909 Hotel Guimard exemplify this total design approach.  He devoted great attention to the public spaces (stairs, doorways, etc.) as well as the private spaces (floor and wall coverings, ceiling ornaments, lighting fixtures, door and window hardware, fireplaces, and furniture).  He particularly appreciated the inherent characteristics of cast iron and did not attempt to reproduce the architectonic forms of wrought iron or stone; at the same time, he made full use of cast iron’s moldable nature, using it to model the curves and reliefs of vegetation relating to the overall design of the particular project.  In 1907, he published a catalog of cast iron elements, Fontes Artistiques pour Constructions, Fumisterie, Articles de Jardins, et Sepultres (ornamental cast iron for buildings, fireplace fittings, garden fixtures, tombs), to which title he appended Style Guimard, in a cartouche; the catalog contained over two hundred models.  His difficult personality hindered his career, which slowed considerably after World War I.  Fearing the coming war and concerned about anti-Semitism (his wife was Jewish), he moved to New York in 1938, where he died in 1942 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",276,"French, 1867–1942; active Paris, France 1885–1929",/m/021f63,18042569,,,,2407,Hector Guimard,,0,0,908,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042569/,6690,71400445,,379665,23424819

"Born in Paris, Lacroix was brought to Rome as a young boy with his mother who was a lady in waiting to Queen Hortense of Holland.  His childhood was spent in the close circle of Queen Hortense and her son Prince Louis Napoleon (later Napoleon III).  Lacroix studied architecture in Paris under Simon Claude Constant-Dufeux and as the watercolor's dedication suggests, this relationship began under more informal terms in Rome.  Lacroix received considerable professional appointments under the Second Empire, including head architect in charge of the renovation of the Élysée Place and designer of several tombs for the Bonaparte family.  Much is written about Eugène's sister, Hortense Cornu (1809-1875), who was a writer, translator, and frequent correspondent with and confidant of Napoleon III.

"nendo is a multidisciplinary design and architecture group co-founded in 2002 in Tokyo by Akihiro Ito, who serves as the managing director, and Oki Sato (b. 1977), the chief designer.  nendo, whose name is a reference to modeling clay used by children, considers its mission to be “giving people a small "" !

"Anna Maria Garthwaite was a freelance designer and worked in Spitalfields, an area outside of London where the silk industry was centered, from 1728 to 1756.  Not much is known of her schooling; however, it is clear that she was well learned in her craft. A tremendously prolific designer, she averaged about 80 designs per year. She typically wrote the name of the weaver to whom the design was sold.",2,"English, 1690–1763",/m/0420yl0,18065355,,,,,Anna Maria Garthwaite,,0,0,16693,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065355/,,,,17116215,23424975

"Lockwood de Forest (1850-1932) was the protégé of the celebrated nineteenth-century landscape painter Frederic E. Church.  Church trained de Forest in landscape painting during the early 1870s and while doing so engendered in his pupil a passion for exotic places and exotic decorative arts objects.  This interest led de Forest first to the Holy Land and Egypt and finally to India, where he set up an atelier in Ahmedabad to produce hand-carved Indian teak which he imported to the United States for use in interior decorating projects.  In Ahmedabad, he was introduced to Muggunbhai Hutheesing with whom he created a workshop for producing carved teak panels and metalwork by native Hindu mistri craftsmen.  Using these imported materials and other objects that he collected on his travels, de Forest provided decorative arts objects for interiors by Louis Comfort Tiffany with whom he had a brief partnership (1880-82). Working independently, de Forest designed interiors for his siblings Robert and Henry de Forest, Frederic  Church, Mary Garrett and M.  Cary Thomas (Bryn Mawr College); George Wroth Knapp (Baltimore); and William Henry Appleton (Wave Hill), among others.",3,"American, 1850 - 1932",,18065337,859,,,,Lockwood de Forest,,0,0,16673,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065337/,,3616962,,,23424977

"Charles Francis Annesley Voysey (1857-1941) was an English architect, furniture and textile designer. After working for various architects, including George Devey’s country-house design firm, he set up his own practice in 1881. While waiting for architectural commissions, Voysey produced wallpaper and textile designs, working under contract for companies such as Essex & Co. and Alexander Morton. In 1884 Voysey was elected to the Art Worker’s Guild, and in the same year became engaged to Mary Maria Evans. Voysey designed a house for himself and his future wife, and although the house was never built, the plans were published in the Architect (1888) which led to other commissions for small houses. While primarily an architect, Voysey had his greatest impact on textile and wallpaper design. His designs were based on extensive study of observed botanical forms, articulated in light, clear, flat colors and defined outlines; he also used varying bird forms which in effect became the Voysey trademark. His work was uncomplicated but skillfully executed, reflecting crucial ideas from the Arts and Crafts Movement. Voysey’s work as an architect and a designer was based on deep religious faith, seen in his respect for God-given forms and in the symbolism of his designs. He became a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, exhibiting watercolor and printed fabric designs in the exhibitions of 1888 and 1889. In 1936, Voysey was the first to receive the Designer for Industry award by the Royal Society of Arts. In 1940, a year before his death, he received the RIBA Gold Medal.",2,"English, 1857 - 1941",,18046811,,,,,Charles Francis Annesley Voysey,,0,0,3365,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046811/,5231,13110832,,2794352,23424975

"Born in Budapest in 1906, Eva Stricker entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at age 17, intending to become a painter, but her mother prevailed upon her to learn some trade whereby she could earn a living, the world of fine art being chancy. So Eva apprenticed herself to a traditional potter and began learning her trade. The life of the apprentice in any of the trades was not always easy or pleasant, but Eva persisted and soon graduated to journeyman status. Just a year after that her work was displayed at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial, where she won an honorable mention. By then she was working as a designer in the Kispester Factory in Budapest. She then advertised in the trade papers that she was a qualified journeyman seeking a position and received several responses. When asked recently why she chose the particular one she did she replied, ""Because it was the furthest from home."" She wanted to travel and widen her experience of the world and at the same time increase her skills. She moved to Berlin and on to other factories in Hamburg and throughout Europe. In 1932 she went to Russia on vacation in order to experience the new artistic and social movements there, as did many other idealistic young artists and intellectuals. As an experienced industrial designer she was soon offered a position assisting in the modernization of the ceramic industry, where her creativity and dynamism stood her well. She traveled to many parts of Russia in order to understand and coordinate the efforts to create a central manufactory which would make products for the homes of the everyday citizenry. Her efforts were recognized, and she was soon transferred to the Lomonosov factory in Leningrad (the former Imperial Porcelain Factory). This in turn led to her appointment as Artistic Director for the Porcelain and Glass Industries for the entire country.

In 1936, however, she was caught up in one of the Stalinist purges, accused of plotting against the life of Stalin. She was imprisoned in the NKVD prison for 16 months, most of the time in solitary confinement. She was subjected to early forms of brainwashing, torture, and the constant possibility that each day would be her last. (Arthur Koestler, a lifelong friend, based his book ""Darkness at Noon"" on her prison experiences.)

Then one day she was unexpectedly led out of her cell to what she feared was to be her execution and put on a train to Austria in the clothes she was standing in. Just as the reason for her imprisonment was never really known, so is the reason for her release.

Once in Austria, she left on the last train out at the time of the Anschluss and went to England, where she married Hans Zeisel, who had waited seven years for her. They then went to New York in 1938, where they settled permanently.

One of her first designs in the US was for Sears, Roebuck. She has since designed for Hall China, Red Wing China, Castleton China, Norleans Meito (Japan), Western Stoneware, Hyalyn, Phillip Rosenthal (Germany), Mancioli (Italy), Federal Glass, Heisey Glass, Noritake (Japan), and Nikkon Toki (Japan), and almost too many others to mention. 

Honors collected by Zeisel include being commissioned by Castleton China and The Museum of Modern Art to design a line of fine porcelain dinnerware, which was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in l947. She has received a senior award from the National Endowments for the Arts (l982), and was the subject of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs de Montreal, in l984. She taught ceramic arts industrial design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from l939 to l952. 
 
Her works are in the permanent collections of Brohan Museum, Berlin; The British Museum; The Brooklyn Museum; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and numerous others. She has had retrospective exhibitions in dozens of museums, has lectured widely, and has received two honorary doctorates in recognition of her work, among other honors.

Her recent works include designs for Zsolnay Factory in Pecs and Kispester-Granit in Budapest, as well as the American firms of KleinReid and Nambe. The Museum of Modern Arts and the Metropolitan Museum have both issued new releases of some of her early designs in new glazes and colors, always supervised by Zeisel. At age 96 she continues to produce new works regularly.",133,"American, born Hungary, 1906–2011",,18043295,,,,,Eva Zeisel,,0,0,1312,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043295/,,,,,23424977

"William Grueby founded this pottery in 1894.  It produced highly acclaimed art pottery, including the famous matte green glazed vases, winning two gold medals, for enamels and glazes and for his personal accomplishment in creating the dull-finished enamels, and a silver medal for pottery design at the 1900 Paris Exposition, and a grand prize at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  Its style and glazing were copied by others, and ultimately it went through a bankruptcy.  The financial problems resulted in the incorporation of the Grueby Pottery Co. and later the Grueby Faience and Tile Company.  Over time, the firm shifted its focus to architectural faience.  The tiles continued to be produced from 1919 until at least 1928 by the Pardee Tile Works in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which bought Grueby’s company (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",14,1895–1908,/m/0bmg030,18043793,,,,,"Grueby Faience Company, Revere, Massachusetts",,0,0,1614,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043793/,37162,,,26710638,

"Giovanni “Gio” Ponti (1891-1979) was an architect, writer, painter, founding editor of Domus magazine, and a pioneer of Italy’s post-war design renaissance. A passionate propagandist for modernist architecture and design at all scales, Ponti lectured in 24 countries; worked in architecture and design for 120 companies, building in 13 countries; and as an editor and writer, produced 560 magazine issues over the course of his 60-year career. 
Ponti studied architecture at Milan Polytechnic until he left to fight in the Italian army in World War I. After the war, he completed his degree, but shifted his career path to work for a ceramics manufactury, Richard Ginori, until 1930. In 1928, he founded Domus magazine as a place to promote his views on twentieth-century industrial design and champion designers and artists whose work he admired. He left Domus and founded Stile, an art and design magazine, in 1941, only to resume editorship at Domus six years later. His dedication to promoting Italian design also included his involvement in the Trienniales in Milan.  
The word “domus” signifies “typical houses”—the Milanese houses Ponti designed beginning in the 1920s that are outwardly conventional, but whose innovative interiors include flexible spaces and modular furniture. He promoted a harmony of form and function, and proper use of materials. 
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, in addition to his editorships, Ponti worked on a range of design projects, from university headquarters, stage sets and costumes, Murano glass, to his 1948 La Pavoni coffee machine, a symbol of Italian coffee bar culture. In the 1950s, he focused on industrial design, including the Superleggera chair, so light a child could lift it with a finger. His 1960s and 1970s commissions include the Hotels Parco dei Principi in Rome and Sorrento, various villas in Italy, Taranto Cathedral, Church of San Francesco in Milan, and other commissions. 
Ponti died in Milan in 1979.",3,"Italian, 1891 - 1979",,18050709,603763,,gio-ponti,,Gio Ponti,,0,0,5977,500003868,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050709/,1198,108666789,,4717272,23424853

"Eugene Grasset (Lausanne, Switzerland May 25, 1841-October 23, 1917 Sceaux, France)
Born in Lausanne in 1841, to a cabinet designer/maker and sculptor, Grasset studied drawing under Francois-Louis David Bocion (1828-90), a student of Charles Gleyre. In 1861, Grasset went to Zurich to study architecture and later sculpture.  Between 1865 and 1867, he traveled to Marseille and then to Egypt.  These journeys would deeply influence his poster design later in life. Upon his return to Lausanne, he worked as a designer of decorative sculpture. In 1877, after six years in Paris, he began his early work as an illustrator, working with popular stories including “Le Petit Nab” (1877) and ""Histoire de quatre fils Aymon"" (1883).  As his career blossomed, Grasset designed furniture, posters, jewelry, and carpets, among many other forms of applied art, as well as architectural design.  His postage stamps for both France and Switzerland in 1877 gained him great popularity in those countries. Soon after, he focused in earnest on poster design. He was one of ninety-seven artists who contributed to Jules Cheret’s Maîtres de l’Affiche, the hugely popular Belle Époque book of posters.

In the 1880s, Grasset’s popularity had reached the United States, where several American companies commissioned him to produced posters and later, the cover for the 1892 Christmas issue of Harper’s Magazine.  The immense popularity of France’s Art Nouveau style reached the United States in part, through Grasset’s connection to Louis Comfort Tiffany, who used his designs as inspiration for stained glass windows. 

Grasset taught at various art schools in Paris, and also exhibited his works at different venues, such as the Salon des Cent (1894) and Salon des Artistes Décorateurs (1904). The most notable exhibition of his work, however, was when the type foundry, G. Peignot et fils introduced the “Grasset” roman and italic typeface at the 1900 Universal Exposition. There he was also represented by tapestry, ceramics, and jewelry. That same year, Grasset published his influential two-volume book, La Plante et ses applications ornementales (1897-1900).",14,"Swiss, 1841 – 1917; active Paris, France 1871–1917",,18042605,629226,,,,Eugène Samuel Grasset,,0,0,927,500029865,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042605/,2376,95179440,,,23424957

"Ryohin Keikaku Company, Ltd., popularly known as Muji, is a Japanese manufacturer and retailer specializing in household and consumer products. The name Muji derives from the Japanese phrase ""mujirushi ryohin"" (""no brand quality goods""). Mujirushi Ryohin started as a product brand of The Saiyu, Ltd. supermarket chain in 1980. In 1983 the first stand-alone Mujirushi Ryohin retail location opened in Japan, with the first international store opening ten years later in London. Muji is now world-wide, with hundreds of locations throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. The company’s design philosophy is distinguished by its emphasis on simplicity, function, selection of materials, efficient manufacturing processes, minimal packaging, recycling, and waste reduction. While Muji products are generally not attributed to individual designers, the firm has worked with notable industrial designers such as Naoto Fukasawa, Konstantin Grcic, and Jasper Morrison. The company’s “no-brand” brand does not rely on traditional advertising to achieve popularity, but on word of mouth from consumers who prefer unpretentious design, reasonably priced quality, and a simple shopping experience.

"Carin Goldberg, the graphic designer and writer, was born on June 12, 1953 in New York. Currently based in New York, Goldberg has become an extremely influential designer. She is known for her quiet, uncluttered and ecclectic style of design which undoubtedly began to take shape during her time at The Cooper Union School of Art, in New York, where she recieved a Bachelor's of Fine Art. Soon after her graduation, from the mid-seventies to the early eighties she worked as a staff designer for CBS Television Network, CBS Records and Atlantic Records under art director Paula Scher.

         After her extensive experience in design and advertising for major music and televisioncorporations, in 1982 she established Carin Goldberg Design in New York where she is currently the principal. Her roster of clients include publishing houses such as Simon nd Schuster, Random House, Harper Collins, Hyperion, Doubleday, Time Inc., and Nonesuch Records, a music company.

        Carin Goldberg's work has been showcased in numerous exhibitions including and design annuals including the Walker Art Museum's ""Graphic Design in America"", the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's ""Mixing Messages"", and in Hong Kong's Heritage Museum in the ""Women Festival"" series. Her work has also been featured in magazines like Graphis, Time Magazine, Ad Week, Communication Arts, Print Casebooks, Metropolis, and Print. Goldberg's work can also be seen in Steven Heller's books ""Jackets and Covers"" and ""Typeplay"" and in her own recently published book, ""Catalog"", which she designed and authored.",32,b. 1953,,18043661,,,,,Carin Goldberg,,0,0,1518,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043661/,,,,,

"Chip Kidd, the new York based graphic designer and writer, has become one of, if not the most famous book jacket designer to date. Born in 1964 and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania; his designs have been, according to Graphic Design: America Two, credited with ""helping to spawn a revolution in the art of American book packaging in the last ten years."" One of the most consistent characteristics of Kidd's revolutionary style is the fact that his book jackets do not have a signature look. According to Kidd, ""A signature look is crippling...[because] the simplest  and most effective solutions aren't dictated by style.""
     
     Kidd graduated from Pennsylvania State University where he majored in graphic design and became interested in the work of Paul Saville, the designer of British record sleeves for whose designs he still considers a major influence on his work.
    
      Most of Kidd's more famous book jackets have been created during his ongoing fifteen years plus run at the venerable Alfred A. Knopf publishing house under art director, Carol Devine Carson, who according to The New York Times ""is credited with helping overhaul old ways of using type, artwork, photography and color on book jackets."" Kidd's list of clients is made up of some of the most well known and celebrated authors of today including Anne Rice, John Updike, Dean Koontz and Michael Crichton for whom he created the now iconic illustration of a dinosaur skeleton for his book ""Jurassic Park"". Kidd's dinosaur skeleton also became the central image of the movie marketing campaign as well. He also designed the catalogue cover for the Cooper-Hewitt's ""Mixing Messages"" exhibitions. 
    
      Kidd's work has been featured in Vanity Fair, Time, The New York Times, Graphis, New York and ID magazines. Chip Kidd has also written about graphic design for Vogue, The New York Times, the New York Observer, Arena, Details, The New York Post and Print magazines. He also wrote and designed the cover for his novel ""Cheese Monkeys"".",15,born 1964,/m/05mx1l,18043673,,97006288,,,Chip Kidd,,0,0,1524,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043673/,,49387975,,1680655,23424977

After stepping down as Art Director for CBS Records in 1982, she practiced as a freelancer before founding the design firm Koppel & Scher in collaboration with Terry Koppel in 1984.  In 1990, she joined Pentagram as a partner. Since the early 1990s, Scher has developed the graphic identity, posters and signage for clients including New York’s Public Theater, Citibank, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Bloomberg, among many others.  In addition, Scher has collaborated with architects to create environmental graphics, and taught as a design educator at the School of Visual Arts in New York. She has received over 300 prestigious awards from international design associations as well as a series of prizes from institutions in the United States such as American Institute of Graphic Design and The Type Directors Club.

"Victor Moscoso (Spanish, b. 1936, active United States) studied at the Cooper Union in New York City and later at Yale University where he studied with Josef Albers. The influence of Albers is evident in Moscoso's use of contrasting color to creat enhanced visual effects. In 1959 he attended the San Francisco Art Institute.  In 1966, he designed posters for venues in San Francisco where rock bands of the burgeoning psychedelic movement played, notably Family Dog dances staged at The Avalon Ballroom.

"Edward F. Caldwell and Victor F. von Lossberg founded Edward F. Calwell & Company in 1894 in New York City. They became the most prominent manufacturers of custom lighting fixtures and metalwork in the late 19th to early 20th centuries.
Their success was due to their ability to incorporate popular and eclectic styles from French Neoclassical to Art Deco into their designs for electric lighting fixtures. Since they worked with the leading architects of the day, Caldwell lighting fixtures and decorative metalwork appeared in many major building projects, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, St. Patrick`s Cathedral, Andrew Carnegie`s mansion (now home to Cooper-Hewitt), and the 1902 renovation of the White House. For these projects, architectural plans would be brought in and drawings and occasionally models would be created. By the 1920s, Caldwell & Company had one of the largest foundries in New York City. They were one of the few American firms that mastered the techniques for applying enamel decorations to metalwork and were renowed for their casting and gilding of bronze. They produced fine metalwork objects such as tables, lamps, clocks, desk sets , fire screens and statues. All items were custom made with few exceptions. Due to the Depression, the firm was forced to scale down their operation. The company was liquidated by the Internal Revenue Service in 1956, but reorganized and reemerged that same year as E.T. Caldwell Lighting Company. The Company eventually went out of business entirely in 1959.",3,"American, 1894 – 1959",,18050417,,,,,Edward F.

"Marianne was born in Finland and went to the Central School of Industrial Design in Helsingfors. In 1930, she worked with her mother, Anna Wegelius, director at Hemflit-Kotiahkeruus. Invited by friend Eliel Saarinen to teach at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1937, she eventually became head of the Department of Weaving and Textile Design. During her 25 years at Cranbrook, she was commissioned a number of times by architects and designers, including Eero Saarinen. Marianne is best known for her use of synthetic fabrics that were especially desirable among major American companies, such as automotive corporations and airlines.
She collaborated with her husband, architect Olav Hammarstrom, designing interiors and textiles. Together they developed a new loom that could accommodate wider widths of fabric. 
Marianne had dozens of solo exhibitions throughout her life. She began donating her works in 1983 to museums around the world.",77,"Finnish, active U.S.A., 1909–1998",,18041443,,,,,Marianne Strengell,,0,0,303,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041443/,,,,,

"Armand G. Winfield has been involved professionally in the plastics field for over five decades. He graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in 1941 and did graduate work at the University of New Mexico, the State University of Iowa and at Washington University in St.Louis, Missouri. He began his career in museum work in the late 1930's and in the mid-1940's was a principal in Winfield Fine Art in Jewelry, a New York City Company involved in research and manufacturing of acrylic embedments. He has since been affiliated with such plastics concerns as Seymour Wallas & Co. and The Ritepoint Company - both in St. Louis, Missouri. He was Research Director of the Hanley Plastics Division of the Wallace Pencil Company in Brentwood, Missouri (1955-1957). In 1957, he was appointed Plastics Consulting Engineer at DeBell & Richardson, Inc. of Hazardville, Connecticut where he remained through 1963. Since January, 1964, he founded his own company where he has been an indipendent Plastics Consultant. Mr. Winfield has been on the teaching faculties of many Universities, Colleges and Istitutes and he also been a guest lecturer at over 30 other universities in the Unites States and abroad. In 1968 Armand G. Winfield was recipient of an United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). On June 9, 1970 The Plastics Institute in London elected Winfield as a Fellow. In 1972 Armand G. Winfield Inc. was retained by C.A.R.E., Inc. to design, develop and produce a low cost prototype house for Bangladesh, primarily using jute as the building material with polyester  binders.  In the 1974 the Winfields were retained by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to consult on their refurbishing of certain opera sets. In 1977, Armand G. Winfield was retained by UNIDO to field consult in India on New Fibres and Composites - and to demonstrate uses of these materials. In 1979, the Winfields completed the refurbishing of an amusement park on Long Island, New York. In early 1980, Armand Winfield was retained by the College of Santa Fe to produce and direct a Conference entitled ""Viable Energy and Living Alternatives for New Decade"".  In 1983, Winfield was invited to become a VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) Volunteer and later that year was elected to the Plastic Pioneers Association. During the past several years, the Winfields have been involved with machine design, product and process development, hydroponic farming and water storage systems for developing countries , recycling of plastics and non-plastics trash and industrial scrap, the development of Affordable housing systems for the United States, working in the electronic field and with new composites - and lecturing and writing for publication. Armand G. Winfield is the author of over 340 published articles, chapters and books on plastics and related subjects, almost 90 of which are concerned with plastics in building and architecture. Articles by the Winfields have been published in many countries around the world in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as in English. Armand G. Winfield is a member of many technical and scientific organizations around the world.",9,"American, 1919 - 2009",,18041403,,,,,Armand G.

"Graphic designer and writer, Louise Fili, was born in Orange, New Jersey on April 15th, 1951. In 1973, she graduated from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York where an opportunity to work in the college typeshop inspired a deep love for typography. Fili specializes in logo, package, restaurant, type, book and book jacket design. She is known for her quiet pretty style of design, often incorperating older less popular typefaces from the 20's, 30's, and 40's. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described Fili's unique style and process when he wrote, ""Fili's work is elegant and refined, possessing great subtlety and even softness. Often, [the] typeface will be a style she remembers from old typographic specimens or will have to be radically altered to achieve her objectives. For Fili, the sad part of the death of handset metal typography is the loss of many wonderful old typefaces which are simply unavailable. She has worked around this problem by restoring letterforms from old printed specimens, commissioning hand lettering of the missinig letters or even the entire title and message."" 

           Louise fili began her design career in 1976 as a senior designer for Herb Lubalin Associates and left the Lubalin Studio in 1978 in order to accept a position as art director of Pantheon Books. Fili stayed at the Pantheon until 1989 when she left to found Louise fili Ltd. where she is currently principal.

           Although Fili has created over 2,000 book covers to date, much of her most well known work, including the book jacket for Marguerite Duras' ""The Lover"", were created during her time at Pantheon Books. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described her work at Pantheon when he wrote, ""Color and imagery also seem to resonate with the essence and spirit of the literature, almost as though Fili has focused more on the logo and food package design, especially on the creation of corporate identities for the restaurants including Picholine and Prix Fixe.

          Fili's work has been included in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. Her work has also been featured in Graphis, Step Inside Design, and Print magazines. Fili has also co-authored many design books with her husband Steven Heller including ""Italian Art Deco"", ""Dutch Moderne"", ""Streamline"", ""French Modern"", ""British Modern"", ""Deco Type"", ""German Modern"", ""Deco Espana"", ""Typology"", ""Belles Lettres"" and ""Cover Story"".",26,,,18041621,,,,,Ms. Louise Fili,,0,0,399,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041621/,,,,,

"One of Japan's leading graphic designers and art directors since the 1960s, Nagai trained at theTokyo National University of Fine Arts in scultpure but left in 1951 to work as a graphic designer for the Tokyo Spinning Co. in Osaka.  Starting in 1960, he worked for the Nippon Design Center, serving as its president and later as director.  By the early 1960s, he had developed a personal style of abstract, geometric, linear forms and patterns that create surreal landscapes. This style appeared in posters for Nikon; GQ magazine; and his freelance work of the 1970s and early 1980s.  By the late 1980s realistic elements entered his design vocabularly.  There have been several retrospective exhibitions of his work, the most recent at the Tokyo, National Museum of Modern Art in 1990.",3,"Japanese, b. 1929",,18053407,,,,,Kazumasa Nagai,,0,0,7443,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053407/,,,,,23424856

"Born in Fribourg, Switzerland, 22 May 1925, Jean Tinguely is associated with the renewed interest in the DaDa movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  From 1941-45, Tinguely studied at the School of Fine Arts in Basel, where he lived until 1952. There he was influenced by the collage constructions of Kurt Schwitters.  At this time he began his interest in movement in art.  After marring Eva Aeppli in 1951, they relocated to Paris where Tinguely worked with Daniel Spoerri in Jean Lurcat's studio on an ""autotheater"" project, which intended to bring action to the stage even in the absence of preformers.  Moving to Dusseldorf in 1959, he made many ""metareliefs""- motorized panels made of moving rods, as well as free standing sculptures.  In one of his early performances pieces, he dropped 150,000 copies of the manifesto Fur Statik from an airplane on Dusseldorf.  In late 1950's an early 1960s he developed the first of the ""painting machines"" which incorporated found, man-made and natural elements.  Concieved as a reaction to the then prevalent Abstract Expressionist style, he helped launch the Nouveau Realisme movement.  After moving  to New York in 1960, he constructd Homage à New York, an elaborate painting machine, in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art, which self destructed.",6,"Swiss, 1925 – 1991",,18046537,610546,,,5882,Jean Tinguely,,0,0,3222,500010804,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046537/,75356,12338336,500010804,7328346,23424957

"Born in Kiev in 1882; died in Fontanay-aux-Roses in 1949.

Exter introduced Russian Construcivism to the world of costume and set design. After training as a painter from 1908 to 1914 in Paris, where she became part of the Cubist and Futurist circles--including Braque, Picasso, Léger, and Marinetti among her professional acquaintances--Exter returned to Moscow in 1914. Two years later she began to work with Alexander Tairov at the Karmerny Theater, which became a laboratory for inventing new ways to design for the stage. She collaborated with Tairov on three productions, at the same time setting up her own design studio in 1918. Six years later, she returned to Paris where she produced designs for the theater along with fashions, interiers, and books.",14,1882–1949,/m/0383hl,18042743,,,,1784,Alexandra Exter,,0,0,1000,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042743/,4432,65651276,,749755,

"Husband-and-wife design team Charles and Ray Eames were formative and among the most influential figures in American design of the mid-twentieth century. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Charles Eames (1907–78) trained as an architect and worked early in his career for engineers, which evolved into a lifelong interest in mechanics and the complexities of how things worked. Bernice Alexandra (Ray) Kaiser Eames, (1912–88) born in Sacramento, California, had an interest in the abstract, and in the 1930s studied painting under Hans Hofmann in New York. Their interests and visions would blend seamlessly into the creation of influential, lasting designs. Together, the Eameses embraced the  concept of modern design as an agent of social change, creating designs for the overlapping needs of client, society, and designer and developing products that would serve all three. 

Ray and Charles Eames met in September 1940, after Ray entered the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Charles was already studying, and would soon become head of the industrial design department. He was working with fellow designer Eero Saarinen on an entry for the Museum of Modern Art's ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings"" exhibition/competition; Ray assisted in preparing drawings, and the result was a first-place-winning molded plywood chair. 

Charles and Ray were married in 1941 and moved to California. By 1943 they opened an office in a renovated garage, from where they worked together until Charles's death in 1978, and where Ray alone continued the practice until her death in 1988. They pioneered technologies, and adapted what had been considered ""industrial"" materials to office and domestic environments. Most notably, they developed a method for bending plywood in multiple directions, a continuation of the efforts begun at Cranbrook. During WWII, the Eameses worked for the US Navy--which granted them access to new synthetic glues--and applied their molded-plywood experiments to develop splints for injured troops, replacing the unhygienic, stiff metal ones previously used. After the war, they used this knowledge and experience to create their now-famous molded-plywood chairs and tables. Originally intended for Evans Products, the furniture was produced and marketed by Herman Miller beginning in 1946. That same year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York granted its first one-man show to Charles Eames, discrediting Ray's contributions to their work, a slight that would have lasting historical consequences.

"Ettore Sottsass was a product designer and architect who had an enormous influence on Italian design in the second half of the 20th century.  Sottsass was born in Innsbruck, Austria but moved with his family to Italy so that he could study architecture at Turin Polytechnic University.  Upon graduating in 1939 he was called to serve the Italian Army until the end of World War II. In 1945, Sottsass opened his own architecture and design studio in Milan. At this time he started designing furniture that experimented with the relationship between three-dimensional space and two-dimensional pattern, a theme that can be seen throughout Sottsass’ career. He worked as a design consultant for the industrial design group Olivetti from 1958-1980, where he created iconic pieces associated with pop culture such as the Elea 9003 calculator and the Valentine portable red typewriter, as well as numerous whimsical objects in glass and ceramic. In 1980, Sottsass co-founded the Milan design group Memphis with fellow avant-garde designers Andrea Branzi, Alessandro Mendini, Martine Bedin, and Michele de Lucchi. Aiming to promote radical design, they produced brightly colored, geometric, and often anti-functional furniture, lighting and ceramics. Memphis dominated the early 1980s design scene and secured Sottsass’ place in history as a founder of post-modernism.  Sottsass left the group in 1985 to focus on his own Milan-based practice, Sottsass Associati, where he worked for the rest of his life. He returned to architecture in his later years to complete a series of private houses and public buildings, notably the interior of the Milan Malpensa 2000 Airport from 1994-1998. In recent years,  Sottsass’ career has been the object of major retrospectives, including exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2006 and the London Design Museum in 2007. His works belong to numerous public collections around the world, and continue to inspire young designers.",10,"Italian, 1917–2007",,18044261,619404,,,,"Ettore Sottsass, Jr.",,0,0,1955,500019835,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044261/,51144,93197959,,385762,23424853

"Of Scots descent, Knox was born on the Isle of Man on April 9, 1864, and died there on February 22, 1933.  He attended the Douglas Grammar School and the Douglas School of Art, where he developed an interest in Celtic ornamentation that was a lifelong inspiration. In the early 1890s Knox worked for Scottish architect M. H. Baillie Scot. He moved to London in 1897, and his association with Liberty began in 1901.  He produced over 400 designs for carpets, fabrics and metalwork (until 1912), and his designs for Liberty’s made him a household name.  His work included jewelry, vases, boxes, baskets, tea sets and inkwells, in silver and pewter, particularly the Cymric and Tudric ranges for Liberty’s, providing decorations in interlacing forms, curves and stylized plant forms, often symmetric and often embellished by enamels, polished stones and semi-precious cabochons (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",5,1864 – 1933,,18044253,,,,3171,Archibald Knox,,0,0,1949,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044253/,1803,64814185,,17507388,23424975

"Founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty (b.1843). Liberty & Company was a shop in London which sold Japanese items. In 1883 the store added a furnishing and decorative studio. In addition to producing original designs, Liberty also imported European furniture, including Art Nouveau objects in the 1890s. By 1898 Liberty's was also making its own silver, and in 1901 began production of pewter objects. Liberty's insisted on the anonymity of its designers, and most of its records were destroyed. Arthur Liberty's encouragement of designers associated with the Arts & Crafts movement and the Art Nouveau style provided powerful impetus to their work, and the store became so associated with that style that, in Italy, A rt Nouveau became known as Stile Liberty.",32,founded 1874,,18044251,,,,,Liberty & Company,,0,0,1948,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044251/,,,,,23424975

"Augustus Charles Pugin possibly came to England during the French Revolution, although the exact circumstances and date of his arrival are not known. In 1792, he 
entered the Royal Academy Schools and worked as a draftsman for John Nash
(1752–1835). In 1799, he exhibited a design for a villa at the Royal Academy. His architectural drawings were outstanding for their clarity and accuracy, and he worked frequently as an illustrator of architectural treatises. Some of his most notable contributions are illustrations for The Microcosm of London (1808) and two volumes of Specimens of Gothic Architecture (1818). After the success of Specimens, Pugin worked for Nash between 1819 and 1824, drawing the plates for The Royal Pavilion at Brighton (1826).

He was not very active as a practicing architect, but probably provided designs for other architects. In 1826–27, he exhibited three designs for cemeteries, and in 1830 he was associated with the layout of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London.

"Louis Isadore Kahn (1901-1974) studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania under Paul P. Cret for whom he worked upon graduation.  During the Depression years of the 1930s, Kahn focused his career on public housing, joining the Works Progress Administration and the Architectural Research Group whose populist agenda was based on European avant-garde social ideas. He opened his own practice in 1935.  After working initially in the International Style, he developed his distinctive approach to architecture in the early 1950s.  In buildings such as the Yale University  Art Gallery (1951-53); the Richards Medical Research Laboratories, University of Pennsylvania (1957-65);  The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA (1959-65); the National Assembly Building, Dhaka, Bangladesh (1962-74); Phillips Exeter Academy Library (1965-1972); and the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, he used combinations of brick, travertine, poured concrete, teak and other woods to create bold monumental structures in which light and the hierarchy of spaces played an important role.  Kahn’s architecture has influenced many architects working long after his death including Tadao Ando, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, Sir Norman Foster, Moshe Safdie, and Robert Venturi.",1,"Estonian-American, 1901–1974",,18064721,,,,2964,Louis Kahn,,0,0,16366,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064721/,,,,53627,

"Louis Sullivan (American, 1956-1924) was one of the most significant  American architects of any era. His work provides a transition from the nineteenth century academic world to the twentieth century. Like his teacher and mentor, Henry Hobson Richardson he considered the decorative elements of his buildings with a particularly keen sense of the aesthetic movement tempered with a strong architectural rationalism.  The Chicago Stock exchange of 1893 was one of Adler (Dankmar) and Sullivan's major commissions, showing a modern aesthetic when compared with the more Beaux Arts styles of some of the buildings at the contemporary World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.",3,"American, 1856–1924",,18050521,,,,5723,Louis Henry Sullivan,,0,0,5877,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050521/,6697,14805742,,52717,23424977

"M. Leon Decloux (b. November 11, 1840 d. May 26, 1929) belonged to a Parisian family whose members were mainly contractors of works of various sorts.  After having begun in the firm directed by his father, at the side of his eldest brother Edouard, he established a gilding shop, then a housepainting enterprise which he rapidly expanded.
He demonstrated at an early age a very marked taste for the art of the 18th century, then fairly unkown, and he was interested in all forms of the art of that era - furniture, engravings, knick-knacks, porcelain as well as the decorative style created by the 18th century artists.  While yet a young man, he began diligently frequenting the auction house and started acquiring, in proportion to his still modest means, some art ojects of quality which his natural good taste enabled him to discover in the public sales and in the antique shops.
His deep study of the style of Louis XVI led him to specialize his painting business in the execution of ornamental painting of that period and he restored, notably, the color ""Louis XVI grey"" which had entirely fallen out of fashion in the Parisian salons, replaced by the deep toned colors adopted at the end of the 19th century.  Some connoisseurs then entrusted to him the complete decoration and furnishings of several private houses of Paris.  He proved, at that time, his taste and knowledge and realized some remarkable decorative ensembles, such as the Hotels de Bretueuil, de Fels, etc.
Devoting himself more and more to the study of the art objects of the epoque of his preference, while still young, he turned over his commercial enterprise to a relative who had become his associate, to such an extent that he would be able to use all his time to collect on his own.  Among his activities in this realm he established a very complete collection of engravings of the modes of the 18th century.  It is this collection which he later sold to some connoisseurs of the United States who gave them to the New York Museum of Decorative Arts.  Up until his last years, M. Decloux did not stop folowing the large sales of art objects and frequenting the Parisian antique dealsers and he continued to group around him a most important collection of furniture and various brick-brack, always of excellent workmanship and notably among these, a very beautiful colleciton sof Severe soft paste porcelain and of porcelains and faiences of the principal French and foreign manufacturers of the 18th century.
Thus, in the course of a long life, M. Decloux, who remained unmarried, lived only for the art of the period which he loved, surrounded by precious objects which he had patiently assembled, guided only by the instinct and personal taste of a born collector.

"Gertrude Mathilde Oppenheimer, a native New Yorker of German origin, was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Her parents, David Edward and Mathilde (née Davidson) Oppenheimer, had three children; Gertrude was the youngest.  Her father worked in New York real estate, but began his career as a diamond importer.  Eventually establishing herself on the Upper East Side, Ms. Oppenheimer led a cloistered life dedicated to collecting embroidered samplers in her Park Avenue apartment.  Her samplers were mostly acquired through dealers and antique shows in New York, with a few purchased from Germany.  As she collected, Ms. Oppenheimer recorded the details of each sampler in a ledger, noting its country of origin, from whom it was purchased and materials.

With a passion and eye for needlework, Ms. Oppenheimer amassed a collection that spans the globe dating from the seventeenth to twentieth century. The samplers come from North America, from Canada to Mexico; all across Europe, from England to Germany, Scandinavia to Italy; as well as Asia and Africa.  Although spanning a good part of the globe, Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection is especially rich in embroideries from Northern Europe, particularly England, Germany, and the Netherlands.

In 1981, the Cooper-Hewitt received the bequest of Gertrude M. Oppenheimer’s collection of over 600 samplers, along with her ledger. Over eighty percent of Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection remains with the Cooper-Hewitt, providing a snapshot survey of variations in sampler embroidery from around the world and across centuries. Ms. Oppenheimer’s bequest has added to the Cooper-Hewitt’s own collection of embroidery, a craft long considered “women’s work,” expanding the breadth of primary sources that can be analyzed to understand the representational and communicative qualities of embroidered samplers.  Samplers were intended to be educational tools upon which young girls and women could practice and refine their handiwork for the household.  Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection includes a variety of samplers related to housework, including darning, alphabets and numbers for marking linen, practice for hemming, plackets, and finishing button holes. Other samplers served as a family record with dates of births, marriages and deaths, as well as a means for mourning and commemoration. The variation in subject matter, including biblical references, nationalist symbols and flowers, reveal what was valued by the embroiderer, or at least what she was instructed to value.  These samplers are more than practices pieces; they provide insight into the personal qualities of the embroiderer and social sentiments of the day.",479,,,18050567,,,,,Gertrude M.

"He was born in Fuerth, Bavaria, Germany, came to this country in 1900 and in 1902 joined a brother, the late Dr. Max Wallerstein, in the establishment of the Wallerstein Laboratories, consultants to the brewing industry on fermentation and allied matters.  
He was educated in Brussels, Belgium, and at the Cooper Union in New York City.  Through the years he and his brother built the business until it encompassed the use of enzymes in many branches of manufacturing, including silk, confectionery, syrup, soft drink and other industries. 
In 1937 he became president of Wallerstein Company, Inc. after the death of his brother and chairman in 1957.  He was also director of many compaines, including the Metal and Thermit Corporation and was a trustee of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx and a member of the Chemists, Centuyr and Harmonie Clubs.  He held more than fifty patents covering the use of enzymes in industry and was known particularly for his invention of a process for retaining the sparkle in bottled beer.
He had donated works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cooper Union, the Brooklyn Museum and Brown University.  Mr. Wallerstein helped many young science students to get established and gave active aid to refugees from Nazi Germany.  He was also active in the work of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
Leo Wallerstein died on November 6, 1958.
Wife was Mrs. Dorothy Calman Wallerstein, a son, George Wallerstein, and two daughters, Mrs. Alice Silton and Mrs. Dorothy Elgar.

"Fuchs studied textile design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel and Zurich and worked in the textile field before becoming interested in jewelry.  Her jewelry has been exhibitied in many one-man shows at galleries and museums thaorughout Europe in the 1980s, including Gallery RA in Amsterdam, the Electrum gallery in London, and the Musee d'art et d'histoire in Geneva.  Her works are in the permanent collecitons of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and many others magor European museums.
Beadwork is a special interst of Sieber-Fuchs, bridging textile and jewelry design as has her career.  In addtion to traditional glass beads, she has also incorporated such unconventional meterials as tiny bits of unexposed photographic film and chopped up newpaper financila pages into her jewelry designs.  Working in Zurich, a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing, perhaps it is not suprising the Sieber-Fuch should turn to pill packaging for its possibilities in texture and ornament.",1,"Swiss, b. 1943",,18051009,,,,,Verena Sieber-Fuchs,,0,0,6133,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051009/,,,,,23424957

"McNish was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, and began painting at an early age. In the 1950s she moved to London and made a career in textile design. She first studied at the London College of Printing and later turned to textiles. As soon as McNish had graduated from the Royal College of Arts in 1957, she was commissioned by Liberty to design furnishing fabrics. She became an important figure in the design world for her unprecedented combinations of patterns and colors. She has been hired to produce several commercial commissions throughout her career, including experimental laminate panels for the SS Oriana liner’s restaurants, textile hangings in dyed cotton velvet for British Railways Board’s offices, and murals and hangings for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ships. 
As a founding member of the Caribbean Artists Movement, McNish took the Caribbean aesthetic to an international audience. She had a great influenced on British textiles. Since 1971, she and her husband, John Weiss, have a studio where design for interiors, silverware and textiles.",1,"Trinidadian, active in England",,18057749,,,,,Althea McNish,,0,0,11505,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057749/,,,,,

"A potter and a porcelain painter, Dalpayrat was born in Limoges in 1844, and went to the School of Drawing and the Municipal School of Painting on Chinaware, after which he worked in Limoges and Monte Carlo. He established his workshop in Bourg-la-Reine in 1889, with his wife and three (later four) sons. He specialized in stoneware with high-temperature flambé glaze and perfected a copper oxide red glaze that became known as ""Dalpayrat red,"" which he combined with yellows along with rich greens, blues and purples to achieve a marbled effect. This brought him considerable attention at the 1892 salon, and in 1893 he won a gold medal at the Chicago International Exhibition. He went on to make highly acclaimed pieces, some of them set with silver by Parisian jewelers like Cardeihac and Keller, and some of his work for Bing was further decorated with bronze mounts by Edouard Colonna. In 1906, Dalpayrat's workshop closed for financial reasons. He died four years later.",3,"French, 1844 – 1910",,18045027,,,,,Adrien Dalpayrat,,0,0,2381,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045027/,1590,62380858,,,

"Trained in the fine arts at the Arnhem School of Art and Industrial Arts from which he graduated in 1961, Karel Martens began work as a book designer for small presses like the Socialistiese Uitgeverij Nijmegen for whom he designed many book covers between 1975 and 1981.  Starting in 1977 he began teaching at ArtEZ College of Art in Arnhem while producing, during the following three decades, designs for the Dutch government including coins, postage stamps and telephone cards. Since the 1990s, Martens’ career has hit many milestones. His work for the architectural magazine OASE has been lauded since he became chief designer in 1990. In 1996 he published, with Jaap van Triest, a celebrated book entitled Printed Matter, containing stunning pages of his digital and traditional letter press design work (now in its third printing).  The book was declared the best designed book in the world by the 1998 Leipzig Book Fair.  Also in 1996, Martens won the Dr. A.H. Heineken Award for the top graphic design in Holland.  In 1997 he initiated Workplaats Typografie (WT) at the Arnhem College of Art, which is a fully functioning graphic design studio run by his graduate students. He has also acted as a visiting professor at Yale University since 1997, hosting an annual three-week intensive in the post-graduate design school.",1,"Dutch, b. 1939",,18064377,,,,,Karel Martens,,0,0,16199,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064377/,,,,,23424909

"Claudy Jongstra (Dutch, b. 1963)  is a contemporary textile designer who practices the ancient technique of felting. She studied fashion design at the Academy of Art in Utrecht, and established her own design studio, “Nót Tom Dick & Harry,” after graduating in 1989. In 1994, after seeing an exhibition on felt at the Textile Museum in Tilburg, she became fascinated with its fabrication process, and has worked exclusively in felt ever since. She is best-known for her Drenth Heath felts, which are characterized by their raw, primitive quality, with long locks of curly fleece still intact.  Since the mid-1990s she has created extraordinary felted fabrics for fashion designers such as John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, and Donna Karan, and architects and designers Steven Holl, Will Bruder, Jasper Morrison, and Marcel Wanders. Jongstra’s fabrics have a raw elegance that comes from her use of materials such as wild silk, wild linen, and wild cashmere, as well as the special (and proprietary) techniques she has developed in her felting.  Jongstra even goes so far as to raise her own sheep in the Dutch countryside and currently has a herd of 200 including the rare species of long-haired Drenthe Heath, whose shorn locks she felts along with the straw and lanolin that accumulates on their hair.",2,"Dutch, b. 1963",,18057439,,,,,Claudy Jongstra,,0,0,11346,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057439/,8647,63757863,,,

"Edward Ruscha was born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska and moved to Oklahoma City when he was five. After studing art in high school, Ruscha moved to Los Angeles and took classes in graphic design at Chouniard Institute and the Walt Disney school for animators (later CAL Arts). Among his influences are the Dada Movement and the paintings of Jasper Johns and  Robert Rauschenberg. His books ""Twenty Six Gas Stations""(1963) and ""Every Building on the Sunset Strip"" (1966) underscored his interest in the every day aspects of contemporary American life.  In the mid 1960s, under the pseudonym Eddie Russia, he was the designer for the contempory art magazine ARTFORUM.  His prints and paintings of words and simple short phrases link Ruscha to both Pop Art and Post-Modernism.  His hard edged, tightly rendered images, show a   fascination with American trompe l'oeil paintings of the nineteenth century and  photography.",2,"American, b. 1937",,18053897,1022,,,5086,Edward Ruscha,,0,0,7705,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053897/,37425,54182318,,1311849,23424977

"Founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Company in Zeeland, Michigan, the firm manufactured high quality traditional wood furniture. By 1919, Dirk Jan De Pree, President of the Company, and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, had become majority stock holders in the firm and renamed it for Miller.

During the Great Depression, the company explored new products and manufactured furniture of modern design in order to increase sales. Working with designers such as Gilbert Rohde by the early 1940s, and later with George Nelson, Charles and Ray Eames, and Alexander Girard, the company manufactured a number of pieces that are now considered icons of mid-20th century modernist furniture. The company also focused on producing innovative office furnshings and furniture systems. Herman Miller, Inc. continues today to create cutting-edge and sustainable design for both the home and the workplace.

"German pottery established at Karlsruhe 1901. Was the resulting combination of two endeavors: ceramic studio set up by painter Wilhelm Süs in 1898 at Kronberg, which produced majolica in the style of Italian Renaissance, and the Oberursel workshop of painter Hans Thoma. Production at Karlsruhe began in 1901. Artists included Hans Meid, Konrad Taucher, Georg Schreyögg, Emil Rudoff Weiss. In 1909 facotry moved to larger facility in Hartwald, where it included ornamental ware for parks, gardens, and cemeteries in its production.  In 1913 court administration of Karlsruhe ceased, and administration of the factory changed hands during the following years. In 1920s its designers included Laueger, Ludwig König, Paul Speck. Factory came under state ownership in 1927, and from thenceforth was known as Majolika-Manufaktur Karlsruhe AG.

"Tommi Parzinger was born in Munich and received professional design training there at the school of art and craft, Kunstgewerbeschule. He began his career as a freelance designer of ceramics, wallpapers, lighting, textiles, furniture. He traveled and worked in Germany and Austria, becoming familiar with the modern movements of the day including the Jugendstijl, the Bauhaus, and the Wiener Werkstatte.As a professional designer in Germany he created porcelain for the German firm KPM, as well as posters, textiles, interiors and wallpapers. In 1932 he came to the United Stated as a prize for winning a poster contest for North German Lloyd. In 1935, he settled in New York and became associated with Rena Rosenthal (""smart furniture and accessories shop"") as a designer of china, glassware and furniture. Furniture became his primary focus and in 1938 he became a designer for Charak of Boston. In 1939, he formed his own business, Parzinger, Inc., renamed Parzinger Originals in 1946. Donald Cameron became his partner. In addition, he designed furniture, fabrics, lighting and range of accessories for other firms, including Salterini (wrought iron); Hofstatter (furniture); Dorlyn (brass); Willow & Reed (rattan). He produced custom designs for interior decorators and his many private clients. Parzinger furnishings changed very little over the years. Rooted in Viennese style, the main characteristics of the furniture were simplicity and a sense of proportion, rich wood textures ornamented with handmade hardware. His designs for silver, ceramics, lighting and glassware used light and joyful animal or floral motifs. In 1996 and 1998 his work was shown by Palumbo Gallery, 972 Lexington Avenue, New York City.",159,"American, born Germany, 1903 - 1981",,18049811,,,,,Tommi Parzinger,,0,0,5482,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049811/,,,,35622315,23424977

"Mark Pollack studied weaving at the Rhode Island School of Design, and still continues to study the RISD collection of historic textiles to create unexpected interpretations. After graduating in 1976, he served eleven years as the associate design director of Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., before founding his own company, The Pollack Studios, eighteen years ago. Pollack is well known for his sophisticated, meticulously crafted fabrics. He is a relentless experimenter who truly respects the technology and craft of textiles. The inspiration for his fabrics comes from the material and construction of the fabric itself as well as the process of creating the fabric. Having started in contract textiles before developing lines for residential interiors, his textiles combine rigorous material engineering with a highly developed aesthetic. Many of them are technical marvels.",9,,,18045517,,,,,Mark C. Pollack,,0,0,2647,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045517/,,,,,

"Eva Anttila was born in Tampere, Finland. She studied painting at the school of the Finnish Art Society between 1913 and 1915, and then studied design, art history, and pattern making. She graduated from the Upper Department of Industrial Design in 1917 with a focus on pattern design.
Anttila participated in several group painting exhibitions throughout her early career and had one solo show in 1923. However, critics questioned why she continued painting when she was already a well-known and extremely talented textile designer.
Between 1917 and 1937, Anttila drew about 200 textile designs for Suomen Kasityon Ystavat, the handicraft association. These drawings demonstrate how her style developed. In the 1910s she focused on design for different textile techniques including embroidery, batik, and weaving, as well as functional designs, such as tablecloths, lamp shades, and wallcoverings; from the 1920s on, her focus shifted to woven textiles used for interior decoration.
Even though Anttila had trained as a painter rather than a weaver, she was able to acquire the knowledge of the weaving technique. She believed that this was the only way to be a successful textile designer. In 1920 she became the first designer of patterns and weavings at the home goods company Kotiteollisuus O. Y. Pirtti.
In 1924, Anttila opened a studio and began designing for interiors; most of all, rugs.  In the 1930s, she traveled around Europe showing her work and won several honors.
After the war, Anttila set aside her paintbrushes and focused solely on tapestry design. Success immediately followed and led to major tapestry commissions from the Finnish Embassy in Warsaw and the Bank of Finland’s office in Vaasa. The latter brought a tremendous amount of attention at an international scale, including North America and South America. At age 69, Anttila visited the United States for the first time and met several prominent artists and collectors. Of particular importance was her introduction to John Hurschler, the California art dealer, who not only sold her tapestries in the United States until 1973, but also gave her ten commissions.
Anttila continued to exhibit her work through the 1980s.",4,"Finnish, 1894–1993",,18063457,,,,,Eva Anttila,,0,0,15629,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063457/,,,,,

"Swedish textile artist, Edna Martin, was a pioneer for women craft artists. First as director of Svensk Hemslöjd, School of Swedish Handicraft, (1945-51), and immediately thereafter as artistic director of the Handarbetets Vänner--The School of the Association of Friends of Textile Art--(1951-77), Martin believed in changing the function of textiles. In Sweden, textiles were seen as having a practical and utilitarian function. They were used for furniture, curtains, and carpets. Martin led a movement to produce textiles that were not functional everyday objects, but aesthetic ones. She created some of the first monumental textile hangings in Sweden.",1,"Swedish, 1908–2003",,18064957,,,,,Edna Martin,,0,0,16477,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064957/,,,,,

"While he was perhaps better known as an architect and furniture designer, between 1909 and 1950 Josef Frank also designed more than 200 textiles. He was familiar with the business from an early age: his father, Ignaz Frank, was a partner in a large textile production firm, and his mother was a highly skilled embroiderer whose work was shown at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. Frank produced his first textile design while still studying architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. 

His interest in pattern design was not unique among Viennese architects like Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, Otto Czeschka, and Dagobert Peche, and he produced several early designs for the Wiener Werkstatte. However, unlike other Wiener Werkstatte designers, who created a unified design scheme by using the same pattern throughout an interior, on textiles, wallcoverings, and even fashion, Frank preferred an eclectic combination of fabrics in his interiors. 

Frank opened a retail shop with Oskar Wlach, who ran the business, called Haus & Garten, which offered furniture, textiles, rugs, and interior design services, and where he acted as the principle designer. But, in 1933 amid rising anti-Semitism in Austria, Frank accepted an offer from Estrid Ericson to work as chief designer for the interior design firm Svenkst Tenn, and moved with his family to Sweden. By the late 1930s, his work with the firm was closely associated with Swedish Modern design, in particular his light, unpretentious cotton prints that were strongly influenced by Indian chintz fabrics, botanical drawings and field guides.",3,"Austrian, active Sweden, 1885 - 1967",,18046343,,,,1971,Josef Frank,,0,0,3107,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046343/,52883,32787930,,20860950,23424750

"Division of Sunbeam, manufacturer of household appliances. Founded 1924 by John Oster in Racine, Wisconsin. First product was a hand held hair clipper for women. Production extended to manufacture of various motors by World War II. Near the war's end, Oster purchased the Stevens Electric Company, which manufactured drink mixers, which Oster later developed into a blender.

"Paul Rand was born in New York City and studied at Pratt Institute, the Art Student's League and Parsons School of Design. While at the League he studied with George Grosz. Author of ""Thoughts on Design,"" an influential book of design practices published in 1946, Rand incorporates collage and montage techniques to create a dynamic visual / verbal communications vocabulary.  Paul Klee and Wasilly Kandinsky provided a starting point for Rand who adapted formal qualities from their Modernist paintings to his graphic designs.  
Rand was the art director of Esquire  and Apparel Arts magazines from 1937 to 1941 and director of the William H. Weintraub advertising agency where he worked in collaboration with Bill Bernbach on the Orbach's department store campaign. His work with Bernbach is marked by a close association between graphics and copy.  He also contributed covers to the cultural journal Direction from 1938 to 1945.
Rand was design consultant for International Business Machines, Westinghouse and Cummins Engine Co. In 1956 he created the logo for IBM. He also designed the logos for Westinghouse, United Parcel Service and the American Broadcasting Company.
Rand received a gold medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, awards from the New York Art Directors Hall of Fame and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Philadelphia College of Art. He taught at Pratt, the Cooper Union and Yale University.
Other books by Rand include: Paul Rand: A Designer's Art; The Trademarks of Paul Rand (Wittenborn, 1960); Design and the Play Instinct (G.Braziller, 1965); Advertisement: Ad Vivum or Ad Hominem? (Daedalus, 1960)",102,"American, 1914–1996",,18042341,,,,4809,Paul Rand,,0,0,787,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042341/,,,,206029,23424977

"Michael Thonet opened his first cabinetry workshop in a rural Austrian town in 1819, where he experimented with the process of using steam to bend wood for furniture.  Shortly after he founded his company ""Gebruder Thonet,"" or Thonet Brothers (1853).  In 1856, he obtained the first patent for the bentwood process.  Although his patent expired in 1869, by 1900, Thonet owned fifty-two assembly line production factories for bentwood furniture across Europe.  Numerous replicas of his most famous chair, the Viennese cafe chair known as model no. 14, abound today.  A New York office opened in the United States in 1873 and was later sold into subsidiaries, whereas in Europe the Thonet family remained involved in the Art Noveau movement.",6,,,18054021,633355,,,5866,Thonet Brothers,,0,0,7769,500034100,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18054021/,42656,143911684,,,

"Hechizoo Textiles, which creates custom textiles for upholstery, rugs, window treatments and paneling, was founded in 2000 by Jorge Lizarazo in Bogota, Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which has influenced his textiles in terms of their structural clarity and use of materials. His designs also benefit from his staff’s diverse expertise in the rich weaving traditions of various regions in South America. Additionally, the staff is trained to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure of the textiles. Hechizoo textiles incorporate both man-made materials, such as metal wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon, with natural materials such as, silk, agave, cumare and penca. The integration of these natural fibers with more industrial products results in the creation of contemporary and sophisticated products.",3,,,18061505,,,,,Hechizoo Textiles,,0,0,14069,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061505/,,,,,

"Born at Great Marlow, Joseph Nash began his drafting career studying Gothic architecture under Augustus Charles Pugin. He went with Pugin to Paris in 1829 to make drawings for Paris and Its Environs (1830), and lithographed the plates in Pugin’s Views Illustrative of Examples of Gothic Architecture (1830). From 1831 to 1879, he exhibited at the Royal Academy; and exhibited at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle, receiving an honorable mention. His early exhibits at the Society of
Painters in Water Colours were mainly illustrations for Shakespeare and contemporary poetry and novels; Tudor and Elizabethan architecture of Knole, Hampton Court, and Speke Hall were also frequent subjects. His published works
include Architecture of the Middle Ages (1838); The Mansions of England in the
Olden Time, published in four sets of twenty-six lithographs (1839–49); Scotland
Delineated (1847–54); and Views of Windsor Castle (1848). (JGK)",4,"British, 1808 - 1878",,18050891,,,,,Joseph Nash The Elder,,0,0,6071,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050891/,3546,122246433,,,23424975

"Giovanni Giacomo De' Rossi was the son of the founder of the most important and active printing press of the 17th century in Rome. Begun in 1633 by his father Giuseppe (1570-1639), the press passed firstly to Giacomo and to his brother Giandomenico (1619-1653), and then later to Lorenzo Filippo (1682-?); in 1738 it became the Calcografia Camerale, from 1870 until 1945 the Regia Calcografica, and today it is known as the Calcografia Nazionale. Here are conserved, amongst many others, the plates of Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778). Giacomo De' Rossi was the most involved of all the various family members who ran the press, and he worked between 1638 and 1691, and was to take the company to the height of its success. The artists that he printed the etchings for included Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1665), Pietro Testa (1612-1650) and Giovan Francesco Grimaldi (1606-1680).

Sorensen studied at the Designskolen Kolding between 1968 and 1972, and then traditional tapestry technique in Switzerland and France in the late 1970s.

"Josef Müller-Brockman (1914-1995) was a pioneering force in the Swiss school of graphic design and one of the most internationally respected members of his design generation.  The Swiss style grew out of European and Russian modernist graphics including constructivist, French modernist, Futurist, Dada, De Stijl and Bauhaus.  Because Switzerland remained neutral during World War II, it was able to to continue the exploration of modern graphic design.  After the war, Muller-Brockmann and his colleagues expanded on early modernist design ideas to formulate a strict set of conventions for the use of photomontage and typography within a mathematically based grid layout.  Because Müller-Brockmann taught at the Zurich School of Arts and Crafts (from 1957) and published many books detailing the elements of the Swiss graphic style, what began as a local movement soon grew into an international style whose influence can still be found in contemporary graphic design, particularly in areas of public signage, institutional graphics and corporate identity programs (Vignelli, Chermayeff and Geismar, April Greiman, among others).",4,"Swiss, 1914 – 1995",/m/04xsmy,18051541,,,,4154,Josef Müller-Brockmann,,0,0,6432,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051541/,54279,34450286,,1375695,23424957

"Brian Connelly (1926-63) is a self-taught American artist.  Little is known about Connelly, but in the late 1940s or early 1950s he became involved with Associated American Artists (AAA), a profitable gallery and organization that was founded in 1934 by Reeves Lewenthal.  Lewenthal and AAA played a central role in “linking modern American art and consumerism” by producing limited edition fine art prints by American artists such as Connelly as well as more famous names as Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood.",1,"American, 1926 - 1962",,18055323,,,,,Brian Connelly,,0,0,10216,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055323/,,,,27413027,23424977

"Retail establishment and product design. Design Research, Inc. (D/R), founded in 1953 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by architect Benjamin Thompson, specialized in the latest post- war products for the modern home. The displays in the stores were considered unique in that they were designed at domestic scale and the products were shown in realistic, homelike arrangements. Products were sought and selected based on the anticipated preferences of customers, not on traditional retail buying patterns. As the time, the availability of ""good design"" was limited to wholesale firms such as Herman Miller and Knoll. Thompson was the first to introduce the work of many European and Asian designers to the American retail market, including the work of the design firm of Marimekko for wich D/R was the exclusive U.S. representative. The company also created many of its own products including chairs manufactured by Thonet. D/R later opened stores in New York City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Thompson's own architectural firm, Benjamin Thompson & Associates, Inc., designed all of the D/R stores. For the San Francisco store, Thompson renovated the former Ghirardelli Chocolate factory. Even after the stores officially closed in 1978, D/R remained a model for many merchants.",5,"American, 1953 – 1979",,18051185,,,,,"Design Research, Inc.",,0,0,6233,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051185/,,,,,23424977

"Maria Kipp was born in Weihsenbrunn, Bavaria and came from a privileged family. Schools and university were recently being opened to women in Germany. In 1918, she enrolled at the Kunstgewerbschule (School of Applied Arts) in Munich. It is not clear if the Bauhaus manifesto had any impact on her education, like it did on some of her classmates. In 1920, she enrolled at the male-dominated Staatliche Hohere Fachschule für Textilindustrie (State Academy for the Textile Industry), in Münchberg, Bavaria. This was a great achievement, as the Academy had never accepted a female student before. Kipp was determined to apply her designs to industry and worked very hard to eventually become, what she called a “textile engineer.” On the weekends, she and her classmates taught themselves how mechanical looms worked by disassembling and reassembling them. After graduating from the Academy in 1923, she was reluctant to begin her career as a textile engineer because she would have to relocate to eastern Germany where the weaving mills were situated. A year later, after receiving a handloom as a gift from a friend, she launched her business.
In 1924, Kipp and her husband Ernst Haeckel moved to Los Angeles, like many Europeans during the interwar period. Alsmot as soon as they brought their looms over to California, and set up shop, they received important commissions. Some of the most important ones were to design drapery for the Los Angeles City Hall and the San Francisco Stock Exchange. Later on she would work with architects, such as Rudolph Schindler and later Richard Neutra. In addition, the Hollywood elite and major department stores began using her designs to decorate their spaces.",5,1900–1988,,18051165,,,,,Maria Kipp,,0,0,6222,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051165/,,,,,

"The Romanian-born Steinberg studied architecture in Milan beginning in 1933, but soon after began publishing cartoons, and by the time he graduated in 1940, his drawings were appearing in Life and Harper’s Bazaar. In 1941, anti-Jewish laws in Fascist Italy forced him to immigrate to the United States. He began publishing regularly in The New Yorker, a relationship that lasted almost sixty years and produced ninety covers and over a thousand drawings and cartoons. Steinberg was an Artist in Residence at the Smithsonian in 1967, and is well represented in the Smithsonian collections, with at least forty works in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.",25,"American, b.

"Hiroshige (1797-1858) Japanese painter and printmaker, known for his landscape prints. Last great figure of the Ukiyo-e school of printmaking. Inspired by the prints of Hokusai, he studied and was apprennticed to, Utagawa Toyohiro. From 1811 to 1830 he created prints of traditional subjects, young women and actors. 1830 to 1845 he concentrated on landscape prints, reaching fame in 1833 with the print series Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. Other travel series, Celebrated Places in Japan, and Sixty-nine Stations on the Kiso Highway, also display the high level of craftsmanship for which he is known. In the later period of his life, the increasing popularity of his images resulted in a falling off of the technical brillance of the earlier work.

"Josef Lobmeyr (1792-1855) founded his glassware company in Vienna in 1822. Lobmeyr opened a ""glass wares"" store, selling products of different manufacturers and serving as Viennese representative of the most important Bohemian glass factories, such as Joseph Loetz. By 1840, Lobmeyr began to design and produce his own glassware as well, primarily Biedermeier table glasses and decanters, combining classic design with innovative manufacturing and glassmaking technologies. The firm's glasses favored utility and a clarity of forms that helped to influence the modern aesthetic. Its initial success was furthered in the era of Ludwig (II) Lobmeyr, nephew of Josef, a successful entrepreneur who understood the importance of having recognized designers and artists design for the firm--which it continues to do today. By then known as J. & L. Lobmeyr, it exhibited at the 1862 International Exposition in London, where it was awarded a gold medal as a glass refiner ""for excellence in the making of crystal glass, tableware, and candelabra."" The firm also showed at the 1873 World Exhibition in Vienna in the working room of the emperor. (Ludwig Lobmeyr served as purveyor of glass and glassware to the Austrian imperial court starting in 1860.) 

J. & L. Lobmeyr continued to exhibit at important international exhibitions throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century, such as Paris in 1925 and the 1939 New York World's Fair. The firm's commitment to design from the artistic heritage of Ludwig Lobmeyr and Josef Storck led to the commissioning of artists from the Wiener Werkstatte, including pieces by Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Stefan and Marianne Rath, Josef Winner, and Michael Powolny. In the late twentieth century, Lobmeyr revived its practice of working with outside designers, including renowned American designer Ted Muehling.

The firm continues to produce elegant and prized glasswares today under the leadership of the same family that founded it nearly two centuries ago.",149,,,18061841,,,,,"J. & L. Lobmeyr GmbH, Vienna, Austria",,0,0,14374,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061841/,,,,,

"Junichi Arai, an important innovator in 20th century textiles, was born in 1932 in Kiryu, a city that has been an important center for textile production in Japan for four centuries. As the sixth generation of a mill-owning family, Arai grew up with fabrics being woven for obis and kimonos. He maintains a deep reverence for traditional weaving techniques and the capabilities that only the hand can provide in the craft of making fabrics. In 1984 he founded Nuno Corporation, a company and retail store that produces and sells innovative functional fabrics. Though his work is very technically innovative, Arai takes a traditional approach with his company by employing local craftspeople to help create his work. He has expanded the potential of a jacquard loom, explored reflective surfaces using polyester slit yarn, developed new interpretations of age-old techniques such as ikat and shibori (tie-dye), and exploited the thermoplastic memories of synthetic fibers to give flat fabrics and third dimension. Because of his extensive work, Arai holds patents on 36 processes.",29,"Japanese, b. 1932",,18045617,,,,,Junichi Arai,,0,0,2700,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045617/,,,,,23424856

"The self-taught textile artist emigrated from Budapest to New York City at the age of 16. She began as a clothing designer for women and children. After World War II, Americans began looking toward more folk and local aesthetics, such as Western and Native American motifs. With Karasz’s interest in her native Hungarian folk traditions, she began creating embroidered wall hangings in that manner. The new “Made in America” mentality that developed after the war also encouraged many crafts people to revive the art. 
After a successful book, “Adventures in Stitches: A New Art of Embroidery,” published in 1949, Karasz went on to guest edit at House Beautiful and is credited as reviving domestic embroidery in the 1950s.",39,1898–1960,/m/02pw57r,18045635,,,,,Mariska Karasz,,0,0,2711,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045635/,,,,9894336,
"Lanette Scheeline was born in 1910 in Northen California. She graduated from the College of Fine Arts at the University of California at Berkeley in 1932. She also took a textile design course at UCLA and a year of course work at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. After teaching Art for one year, Lanette Scheeline began to work for Louma Prints, a textile silkscreen factory in San Francisco. Her work with Louma was cut short by WWII, when she moved to Marin county, to work in a shipyard. After two years of war she established her own design studio in Mill Valley, CA.
It is after 1945 that she designed the wallpaper. She met William Katzenbach, the primary partner for the New York based wallpaper firm Katzenbach and Warren, described in Interiors Magazine of April 1955 as ""Consistently avant guard in both design and technical innovations"". Around 1955 Lanette Scheeline produced a new type of mural decoration for Katzenbach, the ""Tree"" series.

"Diane Itter began experimenting with fiber in 1968. She graduated with an MFA in textiles from Indiana University in 1974. She also studied at the University of Pittsburgh, experimenting with hand-tied knots instead of loom-woven fabrics. Itter set tools aside in order to focus on the material itself. She chose to concentrate solely on one technique and one material—the double half-hitch knot and linen thread. Itter was inspired by pre-Columbian Peruvian cloth, and later incorporated elements of African, Amish and Native American textiles. Before her death, she looked to Asian influences, such as kimono and tunic formats.",1,1946–1989,/m/02z0p97,18045633,,,,,Diane Itter,,0,0,2710,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045633/,,,,12939660,23424977

She first joined her husband's design firm, Printex, in 1949. In 1951, the company was renamed Marimekko, which means ""a little dress for Mary"" in Finnish. During the 1960s and '70s, the firm manufactured cotton, jersey, and wool fabrications, along with paper, laminated plastics, and table coverings. Ratia was known for designing free, easy fashions in bold painterly designs taking much of her inspiration from nature and handicraft. Ben Thompson, the founder of the retail establishment Design Research, Inc. (D/R), discovered Ratia's designs at the Finnish Pavilion of the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1957, and persuaded her to come to the United States.

"The multidisciplinary designer Piet Zwart worked as a photographer, graphic and industrial designer, and architect in the 1920s and 30s.  He is one of the most well known and influential designers from the interwar period, particularly in the field of modern graphic design.   Trained as an architect at the School of Applied Arts in Amsterdam, he was hired by the architect and De Stijl member Jan Wils, from whom he absorbed the abstract, linear, and geometric qualities of De Stijl design into his own work.   He soon rejected some of the movement’s principles, notably the emphasis on symmetry, the use of strict horizontals and verticals, and the stern dogmatism.  In addition to De Stijl, Zwart was drawn to other avant-garde movements, particularly Russian Constructivism and Dada.  While Zwart worked for the architect Hendrik P. Berlage from 1921-27, by 1923 he had already began his graphic design and typographic career.  He was hired by the Nederlandsche Kabelfabriek (Dutch Cable Manufacturers) in Delft, for whom he made hundreds of designs for advertisements and brochures.  Zwart remained with the company until 1933 when he resigned to become an interior, industrial and furniture designer.  


Zwart is best known for his graphic design work.  Recognizing typography as a powerful cultural force, he identified himself as a ‘typotect’--part typographer, part architect in that he built a composition with text.  His work is characterized stylistically by the use of primary shapes and colors, varying typefaces, strong diagonals, and a careful asymmetry, at the same time integrating visual puns, alliteration and repetition.  In 1926 Zwart began using photomontage in his compositions, creating contrast between two-dimensional type and the three-dimensional image.  His innovative style and methods were noted by members of the Bauhaus School in Dessau who invited Zwart to host a series of lectures in 1929. Starting in 1930, Zwart was hired by the Bruynzeel Wood Company for whom he designed printed advertising, packaging and office interiors.  His most important Bruynzeel commission was a modular kitchen constructed from prefabricated units which was mass produced from 1938 for the Dutch market.   Arrested and held hostage by the Germans during World War II, he concentrated afterwards primarily on industrial design. His influence on generations of succeeding designers has been greatly recognized and won him the title of ‘Designer of the Century’ by the Association of Dutch Designers in 2000.",5,"Dutch, 1885 – 1977",/m/082hnj,18044821,,,,6592,Piet Zwart,,0,0,2266,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044821/,,,,2784087,23424909

"Pottery operating out of a convent in Meurthe et Moselle region of France. The Huart family owned both pottery and convent. In 1865 the pottery passed into the hands of Fernand and Hyppolye d'Huart, who built new workshops producing wares decorated with enamel, known as ""Emaux de Longwy,"" similar in appearance to the cloisonné enamel technique used in metalwork.

The enameled faience technique was developed at Longwy in response to the popularity of cloisonne from Persia and Japan. In 1870, factory directors Fernand and Hippolyte d'Huart hired Italian artist,  Amedee de Caranza, to create a pottery that resembled cloisonne and would appeal to the general taste for orientalism in France. Caranza had worked in Japan and understood the traditional brass wire technique used in cloisonne. At Longwy he developed and perfected a method of printing black lines on the surface of fired earthenware to create a thin, bas-relief wall around each design segment. The individual cells were hand-painted in the studio with enamels -sometimes using as many as 25 different colors, the piece was then re-fired. Burnt sienna or India ink was rubbed into the surface of the piece to pick up fine glaze cracks or crazing. Amedee de Caranza later moved to Bordeaux to work for a competitor, but his technique remained a signature style for Emaux de Longwy.

Currently, the firm is known as Société des Faienceries de Longwy et Senelle.",1,founded late 17th century,,18044879,,,,,Longwy Pottery,,0,0,2301,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044879/,,,,,23424819

"She was born in Munich and enrolled at the Kunstgewerbeschule in 1914. During the war, she volunteered as a nurse for the Red Cross. After the war, she returned to her studies and encountered the Bauhaus manifesto; from then on, she continued her studies at the Bauhaus school, having received a scholarship to attend. Stölzl was responsible for developing and launching the weaving workshop at the Bauhaus when it moved from Weimar to Dessau.  In 1925, she became the weaving director and instructed many students on weaving and dyeing techniques. In 1929, she married Arieh Sharon, an Israeli architecture student and in 1931, because of Nazi pressure, Stolz was forced by director Mies van de Rohe to resign from the Bauhaus school. That same year, she moved to Zurich and founded a private handweaving workshop which received some important commissions.",1,"German, 1906–1981",,18052859,,,,,Lena Bergner,,0,0,7148,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052859/,,,,,23424829

"Koons began working with his father, who owned a printing business, at an early age, practicing design by creating greeting cards and posters.  During his teenage years he continued to assist his father with client projects.  This early interest in design provided a good foundation for his undergraduate training at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.  He has worked as an illustrator and graphic designer, creating business and brand identities as well.  His archives are located at the Hagley Museum, Delaware, and other examples of his artwork are in the collection of Yeshiva University Museum.",12,"American, born 1922",,18064185,,,,,Irving Louis Koons,,0,0,16026,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064185/,,,,,23424977

"Born in 1952 in Dumbarton, Scotland, David Byrne is a well-known musician and a founding member of the band “Talking Heads.” His work has won Grammy, Oscar, and Golden Globe awards, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Living in the United States since childhood, he briefly attended the Rhode Island School of Design. He dropped out to form a band, eventually founding “Talking Heads” in 1975. After performing in New York clubs for two years, the band had gained extreme popularity by 1977. In addition to his success as a member of Talking Heads—which broke up in 1991—Byrne has also enjoyed a career as a solo performer. He has worked in film—including the music for The Last Emperor, which won an Oscar for Best Original Score—and theatre. He has founded an independent record label, Todo Mundo. In 1987, he was married to the costume designer Adelle Lutz, with whom he had a daughter, Malu Abeni Valentine Byrne.

"Henry Dreyfuss, American industrial designer, was born in New York City, New York in 1904 and died in Pasadena, California in 1972. 
At the New York Society for Ethical Culture's High School he learned the rudiments of staging theatrical production and in 1923, he became active as a stage designer for the theatre productions on Broadway. He worked as an apprentice with Norman Bel Geddes on several hit shows, and also as design consultant for Macy's, where he insisted on collaborating with the manufactures. In 1927 Dreyfuss set out on his own and in 1928 opened his own office in New York; subsequently, opened a second office in Pasadena, California. Soon, he distinguished himself as a designer for mass production. By favoring practically over art deco and streamlined styling, he gained the use of anthropometrics (the study of human dimensions and capabilities) into his practice; the results of this study were published in a series of volumes by MIT Press and discussed in his books Designing for People (1955) and The Measure of Man (1960). Dreyfuss became a founding member of the Society of Industrial Design and first president of the Industrial Designers Society of America. The vast number of objects Dreyfuss designed included aircraft interiors for Lockheed, hearing aids, clocks, Bell telephones (1930-33 Bell300 and 1965 Trimline model), Hoover products (from 1934), RCA TV sets (from1964), decanters for Thermos, farm vehicles for John Deere (including 1956 720 tractor), oceanliners Constitution and 1951 Independence, and New York Central Railroad's 1941 Twentieth Century Limited, which was more extravagant than usual for Dreyfuss. 
In 1968, after retiring from his design firm, Dreyfuss remained consultant to Bell Laboratories, Polaroid, and others.",207,"American, 1904–1972",/m/05p6rp,18041501,656174,,,,Henry Dreyfuss,,0,0,335,500059346,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041501/,,8198939,,1697559,23424977

"Schira received her BFA from RISD, studied at L’Ecole d’Art Decoratif in France, and later got her MFA from the University of Kansas. She traveled around the world, including India, Japan, Virgin Islands and Europe. Schira became interested in Peruvian textiles because the techniques used were nothing like European traditions. In the 1960s and 70s she began experimenting with ikat dyed warp designs, then with weaving strips of aluminum through her works, combining them with fiber warp. In 1973, she began experimenting again, this time using rayon ribbon and pre-dyed tapes. Although she incorporates all these materials, she is still true the traditional technique of flat tapestry hanging. Several public spaces own her large scale tapestries.",1,b. 1934,,18057533,,,,,Cynthia Schira,,0,0,11397,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057533/,,,,,23424977

"White attended Antioch College and Pratt where she worked with Jack Lenor Larsen and John Pile. She became interested in Japanese paper while still in high school and after purchasing some began experimenting by folding and painting it. In 1960, she traveled to Japan on a Fullbright Grant. White met Karl Mann, who liked her work and hired her to produce wallpaper. Her first collection was launched in 1958. She filled orders sent to her by KMA and every year introduced a new collection. White developed the technique of glass monoprinting. Later she experimented with larger and heavier paper and more complicated folding techniques.",45,,,18052919,,,,,Barbara White,,0,0,7179,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052919/,,,,11807230,

"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born on November 24, 1864 in southern France.
Son and heir of Comte Alphonse-Charles de Toulouse, he was the last in the line of an aristocratic family that dated back a thousand years. Today, the family estate
houses the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec. At age twelve Toulouse-Lautrec broke his left leg and at fourteen his right leg. The bones did not heal properly, and his legs ceased to grow. He reached maturity with a body trunk of normal size but with abnormally short legs. He was only 4 1/2 feet (1.5 meters) tall.
Deprived of the physical life that a normal body would have permitted, Toulouse-Lautrec lived completely for his art. He dwelt in the Montmartre section of Paris, the center of the
cabaret entertainment and bohemian life that he loved to depict in his work. Dance halls and nightclubs, racetracks, prostitutes- all these were memorialized on canvas or made into
lithographs. 
In order to join in the Montmartre life - as well as to fortify himself against the crowd's ridicule of his appearance -Toulouse-Lautrec began to drink heavily. By the 1890s the
drinking was affecting his health. He was confined first to a sanatorium and then to his mother's care at home, but he could not stay away from alcohol. Toulouse-Lautrec died on
September 9, 1901, at the family chateau of Malrome.",3,1864 – 1901,,18053903,,,,,Henri Marie Raymo Toulouse-Lautrec,,0,0,7708,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053903/,,,,,

"WMF - Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik  was originally founded in 1853 in Geislingen an der Steige, as a metalworking shop, but in 1880 it merged with another company and took on the name of Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik  or Metalware Factory of Württemberg. Thereafter it was actively acquiring other companies, including a Polish metalwork company, and then the Kunstanstalt für Galvanoplastik München, which specialized in electrotyping and electroforming. In 1900, WMF acquired an Austrian metalwork company, Albert Köhler's AK & CIE, who produced and distributed WMF items under their mark to the Austria-Hungarian market until about 1914, accounting for some of the Wiener Werkstätte influences the firm’s production.
 By the early1900’s, WMF was the world's largest producer and exporter of domestic metalware, much of which was in the Jugendstil, or Art Nouveau style, but other examples showed the craft movement influence of the Wiener Werkstätte too. The best- known period was during the directorship of Albert Mayer, a sculptor and designer, from 1884 to 1914.  The firm acquired numerous other holdings, and continues to this day. It was acquired by Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts in 2012.",7,1853-Present,,18055821,,,,,Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik (WMF),,0,0,10487,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055821/,,,,,

"Porcelain manufactory. Founded in 1889 by Walter Scott Lenox (1859-1920), as Lenox Ceramic Art Company. Organized as a studio, not a factory, producing one-of-a-kind artwares. c1902 the company began to offer custom-designed service plates, and soon after began producing complete dinnerware sets. In 1906 company changed name to Lenox Incorporated. In the late 1920s Lenox joined the war effort, offering Lenoxite, a resilient ceramic material used in radar and electronics equipment.

"Sony Corporation was formed in 1946 in Tokyo as a radio-repair shop, and today manufactures an array of technological goods to great success. Sony's radios launched the company to fame and became the first Japanese design to achieve international status. In the 1950s, Sony developed a reputation for transistor technology, which it used in portable radios. The company produced the TR-55, it's first transistor radio, in 1955. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Sony's design department had a distinct approach to radio design, which became a design philosophy for all their consumer electronics: ""...create a market with bold, innovative, products. Refine the approach. Create the icon that everyone recognizes....""

"Kowaliska studied in Berlin and graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Vienna in 1927.  She looked to folk art as inspiration after moving to Vietri sul Mare, Italy, to join an artist group called the “Germans of Vietri,” considered to have been responsible for reviving Vietri pottery.

"In 1957 weaver and artist Anni Albers began her lengthy association with Knoll Textiles acting as a consultant on a line of new textiles, which included a series of casement fabrics. These fabrics are typical of Albers work during her years as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus, as well as her later work in the United States where she and her husband, Josef Albers, emigrated in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College (1933-49). The design of these casement fabrics recalls her entirely functional approach to textiles with an ongoing curiosity about and experimentation with new fibers and techniques.",45,"American, b.

"Dora Jung was born in Helsinki, in 1906. She studied weaving at the Finnish Friends of Handicraft, and then attended the Helsinki School of Arts and Craft and in 1929, and in 1932, after graduating, opened her own workshop under the name Dora Jung Textil.  Throughout her career, she was commissioned by the Finnish cultural ministry to design curtains for public buildings, such as the theater and Finlandia Hall. Her contemporaries knew her best for developing the a new way to design damask fabrics, known as the Dora Jung technique. 
From the 1930s on, she fabricated damask textiles for Oy Tampella Ab, the major linen manufacturer.",10,"Finnish, 1906–1980",,18046235,,,,,Dora Jung,,0,0,3042,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046235/,,,,,

"Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Testa (1921 -1984) was the first graduate of the Institute of Design in Chicago, the former ""New Bauhaus,"" under Lazlo Moholy Nagy, textile artist, Marli Ehrman, and architect, George Fred Keck.  While still a student, he devised a rational theory for printed textiles and wallpapers that challenged the Bauhaus's strictly functionalist emphasis on textured woven (as opposed to printed) fabrics.   He reasoned, ""The textile designer…must determine what the function of [the] fabric is and what justification he has for putting a design on it.  He needs to experiment with line, form, texture, and colour, …and refrain from complete coverage, destroying the natural beauty of the textile.  Texture should be emphasized where the decorative function of the fabric is minimized, and colour and form where the function is purely decorative.""  Two years after graduating from the Institute of Design, Testa set up his own firm Angelo Testa & Co. Yet he never actively promoted his design business, unlike his better-known contemporaries Ben Rose and Ruth Adler Schnee, which may explain why his name is not more familiar to the general public.

As a painter as well as a designer, Angelo Testa was familiar with the work of contemporary abstract artists.  Between 1942 and 1960, he introduced to textile design abstract and nonobjective patterns using combinations of thick and thin lines, solid and outlined forms, positive and negative spaces, and ""clean pure colors.""  Some designs were screenprinted by his own firm, Angelo Testa & Co., which he founded in 1947,  others were produced by Greef, Forster Textiles Mills, Knoll Associates, and Cohn-Hall-Marx, all for the up-scale market.  These and his mass-produced roller printed designs (1947), which appeared as illustrations in shelter magazines, contributed to the rise of abstract printed textiles in Europe, especially in England. Other clients included Herman Miller Furniture Company, and the textile manufacturer, F. Schumacher & Company.",13,"(American, 1921–1984)",,18046223,,,,,Angelo Testa,,0,0,3036,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046223/,,,,,23424977

"After learning to weave, Edith Snow began teaching art classes, first at the University of Kansas, where her father was president, and later at Stanford.

"Maria Mundal was born in Norway. She learned tapestry weaving from her mother, a common Norwegian practice that is passed down from mother to daughter. Mundal produced home goods along with the rest of the women of the family, such as bedding, warm clothing and rugs. However, what she valued most were tapestries, which she deemed things of beauty.  
She and her husband, artist Mons Breidvik, with his seven children, moved to the United States in 1927. Too busy with her family to produce any tapestries, she did not open a studio until after WWII. By then she had already divorced and was working in Brooklyn. 
Mundal’s tapestries recall folk legends, myths and poetry. She was also a poet and translated famous English poems into Norwegian and vice-versa.",7,1893?–1974,,18046233,,,,,Maria Mundal,,0,0,3041,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046233/,,,,,

"SALT is a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, and specializes in custom window treatments for commercial and residential interiors. Swindell holds a BA in Textile Design from Liverpool University and an MA in Woven Textiles from Trent University. Thomas studied Textile Design at Leeds University and completed a Masters in Knitted Textiles at the Royal College of Art. Both teach and lecture throughout the UK. Swindell is herself a weaver, and the company also employs five additional hand-weavers in a cottage-industry model to make samples and weave their products. 

For ten years, the pair has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because they have focused on window treatments, they are concerned with privacy, managing light, and the appearance of different materials in day and nighttime lighting. Many of their textiles play with sheerness and opacity with areas to look at and areas to look through, surfaces which attract the eye and others which allow light, and vision, to pass through.",3,,,18060333,,,,,June Swindell,,0,0,13306,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060333/,,,,,

"Gallé was born in Nancy on May 8, 1846, and died there on September 23, 1904.  Son of a faience and furniture manufacturer, he studied philosophy, botany and drawing (owing to his botanical knowledge, his floral decoration, in both glass and wood, is exceptionally accurate), and also worked in his father’s studios.  In 1866-7, he served an apprenticeship in glassmaking at Burgun, Schverer & Cie. in Meisenthal. He established his own glass studio in 1873, and, in the following year, took over his father’s glass and ceramics factory in Nancy.  His early work often used colorless glass decorated with enamel, but he soon turned to using heavy opaque glass carved or etched with floral/plant motifs, often in multiple colors.  He also experimented with inclusion of metallic foils and air bubbles.  He had highly successful showings at the Paris Exhibitions of 1878 and 1889, and at the 1891 showing at the Société national des beaux-arts, and, in particular, he showed over three hundred pieces at the 1884 Union Centrale des Arts Décoratifs exhibition, displaying his mastery of techniques, his knowledge of nature and his artistic imagination.  He established a glass workshop, the Cristallerie d’Émile Gallé, to produce in volume his designs and those of others; at its height, it employed 300 workers, and it remained in operation until 1936.  He employed master craftsmen who applied his signature only after he had approved the work.  He is still considered the dominant figure in French cameo glass.  He also produced fine pottery, furniture and jewelry, having opened a small woodworkers’ shop in 1884-5, where he experimented in marquetry designs for furniture.  He had an outstanding showing at the Paris Exhibition of 1900, with a working glass furnace at the center of his display.  In 1901, he founded and became the first president of the École de Nancy, an alliance of Lorraine artists that was an important force in French Art Nouveau.  After his death, in 1904, his wife and daughters supervised the firm’s business (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",12,"French, 1846 – 1904",/m/01gtzn,18042001,690997,,,2058,Emile Gallé,,0,0,611,500094535,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042001/,10124,46769213,,225297,

"Rhodes studied at the Royal College of Art in London and majored in printed textiles. By the 1970s, she was at the forefront of British fashion with her bold, dynamic, colorful and feminine prints that were seen as anti-establishment in Great Britain.  In 1969, Rhodes set up her own studio and then took a collection to New York where it was featured in American Vogue. As her name became more recognized, she began supplying her work to major American department stores, like Neiman Marcus. She was considered the “Princess of Punk” for her use of tears, holes, and safety pins in her garments. Rhodes has designed jewelry, wrapping paper, and costumes for operas in the United States. She was a also a founder of the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, which opened in 2003.",5,"British, b. 1940",/m/05vnsy,18042039,676210,,,,Zandra Rhodes,,0,0,630,500079598,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042039/,69872,8809053,,,23424975

"Chwast studyed drawing with Sidney Delevante at  Cooper Union, graduating with Milton Glaser, Ed Sorel and Reynold Ruffins in 1951.  His drawing style was influenced by Paul Klee, Roualt and Ben Shahn.  After working at the New York Times, Esquire, House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Chwast, with Sorel and Ruffins developed Push Pin Studio in 1954. Producing a wide variety of illustrations, posters, typography and animation, as well as design for packaging, magazines, record albums and book covers, Chwast's designs are a sophisticated blend of raucous colors, and comic book drawing.  Often incorporating inventive typographic juxtapositions appropriated from over a century of handbills, illustrations and advertising, Chwast has influenced a generation of graphic designers and and typographers.  In 1971 He was elected to the Board of Directors, American Institute of Graphic Arts and in 1971-72 he co-designed and directed ""Audience"" magazine.  He was appointed a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale in 1975, the same year he founded Push Pin Press.  He edited and published Push Pin Graphic in 1976, became Director of Pushpin Luballin Peckolick in 1982 and was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1984.  Since 1985 he has been Director of The Pushpin Group.
He has had many one person exhibitions in New York, California and Florida as well as London, Paris, Vienna, Warsaw and many other European capitals.  In March 1970 Push Pin Studios was the subject of a two month retrospective at the Museé des arts decoratif.  Chwast has been a member of the faculty of the Cooper Union and The School of Visual Arts and also lectures to student and professional groups.",14,"American, b. 1931",,18042087,,,,1122,Seymour Chwast,,0,0,656,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042087/,13526,96524183,,1750945,23424977

"The firm was founded in 1883 in the Hague and produced art pottery for both decorative and utilitarian purposes, playing an important role in disseminating the modern Art Nouveau style in the Netherlands.  It took on a new ceramic style under the directorship of Th. A.C. Colenbrander and then, from 1894/5, under J. Jurriaan Kok, under whom the firm developed a line of egg shell porcelain, introduced in 1899, and displayed in the Rozenburg pavilion at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  This was an extremely thin and lightweight earthenware, strengthened by glazing inside and out.  The technique involved biscuit heating of the bare shard at a very high temperature (up to c. 1500 C) [during which the shard received the nonporous skin necessary to hold the subtle painting] and then  polish-heating of the glazed shard at a lower temperature.  The decoration consisted of images, often in a stylized naturalistic manner, of flowers, insects, birds, etc., along with open spaces in white or cream (occasionally light blue) and backgrounds showing the influence of Javanese batik.  The products were tea, coffee and chocolate services, of which octagonal cups became best known, along with vases, plates, and ornamental products.  The decorations were designed by a few master painters, especially Samuel Schellink and J. W. van Rossum, who worked there during most of the firm’s existence, along with designs provided by Sterken and others.  The designs were applied in pencil and then one or more painters would complete the decoration.  The process resulted in the products being expensive; despite wide public acceptance, sales declined as economic conditions worsened.  The firm ceased production in 1914 and was liquidated in 1917 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",17,Active 1883–1913,,18048495,651965,,,,Rozenburg Pottery and Porcelain Factory,,0,0,4459,500054784,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048495/,,135947991,,,23424909

"Peggy Angus saw art as something that all should enjoy. In 1922, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied design from Paul Nash, whose style was deeply rooted in English tradition. Upon graduation, Peggy began teaching in Nuneaton, where she also explored social realism in her artwork. In 1933, she moved to Sussex where she rented a cottage that would become the central meeting place for all her friends and colleagues. Architects, artists, designers, and thinkers of the day met there making it a wonderfully creative environment for all involved.
Peggy’s social leanings were apparent in her work and she became known as “Red Angus” for her visit to Russia and her illustrations in The Daily Worker and the Labour Party. She was teaching at North London Collegiate School, when the linocut designs she had her students make for tiles were noticed by architect FRS Yorke. She eventually was commissioned by Heathrow Airport, which was newly constructed. 
Peggy established her hand-blocked wallpaper design practice in 1960. She produced bold and colorful designs that she preferred over machine-made papers.",2,"British, 1904–1993",/m/05c55pq,18046643,,,,,Peggy Angus,,0,0,3276,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046643/,11334,96514324,,21168564,23424975

"Venini Glassworks, originally founded as Cappellin Venini & C. by Paolo Venini and Giacomo Cappellin in 1921, is arguably one of the best-known manufacturers of fine Italian art glass and lighting. The company hired Italian painter Vittorio Zecchin as its first art director. Throughout its history, Venini used major national and international expositions to introduce its wares to a worldwide audience and create an export market  for premium examples. 

In 1925, the founders parted ways and VSM Venini & C. and MVM Cappellin & C. were established separately; Venini was led by its new artistic director and sculptor Napoleone Martinuzzi. By the early 1930s,  Paolo Venini—who had studied the techniques of artistic directors and artisans from early on—took an increasingly visible role in the company’s artistic direction. Carlo Scarpa arrived in 1932, and took the position of artistic director until 1946, designing lamps, domestic designs and objets d’art.

Early Venini glass reflects the streamlined Art Deco style the company helped to popularize. Venini was also known as a place where artists could collaborate with Venetian glass artisans,  to pursue their own visions in glass with the help of Venini.  The company  worked with many major designers including Gio Ponti, Carlo Scarpa, Ettore Sottsass, Fulvio Bianconi, and others. 
Venini was a pioneer who introduced what today is known as mid-century modern design, especially with lighting using glass in colors of 1950s modernism. Venini designs have simple shapes and striking colors. Paolo Venini died in 1959, but the firm continues in Murano, collaborating with artists and designers .",17,founded 1925,,18044739,,,,,Venini Glassworks,,0,0,2220,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044739/,,,,,23424853

"Architect, Keith Murray (English, born in New Zealand, 1892-1981) was a notable and influential Modernist designer in the fields of glass, ceramics and metalware from 1920 through the start of World War II. He was one of the first designers to be honored for his contributions to industry, awarded the title of Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts, in 1936.

Murray trained and worked as an architect until the early 1930s, when he was forced to seek work outside his field due to the Great Depression. Inspired by the 1925 Exposition in Paris and the 1931 Exhibition of Swedish Industrial Art in London, with its emphasis on co-operation between manufacturers and artists, he produced some glass designs.  He was subsequently hired by the glass firm of Stevens and Williams as a freelance designer, from 1932-1939. His designs ranged from vases to decanters to bathroom sets. Although Murray preferred pure form with minimal to no decoration, he recognized the need to design for a range of consumer tastes and created a wide variety of both traditional and  modern forms. 

In 1932 the ceramics manufacturer Wedgwood engaged Murray part-time to design a range of modern shapes. The simple forms designed by Murray were either plain or had broad geometric fluting or bands. The purity of form was underscored by the use of matte glazes in white, green, turquoise, straw and gray. Murray designed a variety of objects, including vases, book ends, inkwells, beer jugs, and mugs.

Murray also created metalwork for the firm Mappin and Webb. His designs in silver and silver plate were modern and mostly geometric in form. Decoration was limited to turned rings which both enhanced the shapes and made the pieces easy to clean.

In 1936 Murray was commissioned to design Wedgwood's new factory at Barlaston. Following the war he left the field of industrial design and returned to architecture full time.  His design work is in the permanent collections of  the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Wedgwood Museum, and the Corning Glass Museum, among others, and has been included in exhibitions on ceramics and 20th-century design.

"French bronzeworker and sculptor. Thomire trained as a sculptor but decided to follow his father's steps into the trade of the bronzeworker. He received his mastership as a bronzier-fondeur in 1772 and established his own business in about 1775. From about 1780, he was involved with the Grands Vases, initially assisting Jean-Claude Duplessis in the making of the mounts. On the latter's death in 1783, he took over Duplessis' job of supplying mounts for Sevres. Thomire continued making bronzes during the turmoil of the Revolution as well as mounting porcelain for Sevres until 1792. In 1804, he bought the extensive business of the marchand-mercier Martin Eloi Lignereux, which enabled him to operate a wider field, as a retailer of furniture, decorative objects and Sevres porcelain. His new firm rapidly achieved prominence and received many Imperial commissions. In 1809, Thomire was granted the title of Ciseleur de l'Empereur and in 1811 his firm was granted the title of Fournisseur de leurs Majeste. Thomire retired in 1823 and the business was continued by his two sons-in-law until 1852.",1,1751–1843,/m/02vrqn_,18044759,,,,,Pierre-Philippe Thomire,,0,0,2232,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044759/,9933,34705014,,12157374,23424819

"Dr. Walter Leo Hildburgh was born in New York in 1876 into a family which had emigrated to the United States in the early ninteenth century.  He attended Columbia University, where he obtained a Ph.D. and afterwards engaged in various forms of scientific research.  Since he did not have to depend for his livelihood on the proceeds of his research he was able to find time to become a figure-skater of international status, as well as a first-class swimmer.
He began to travel abroad in 1900 and therafter his life was one of travel. In that year he started a prolonged tour of Japan, China, and India.  At an early stage he began to develop as a collectior but his interest was at first attracted by folk-lore and anthropology.  Three further visits were made to the same area in the following years and he made a prolonged stay in Ceylon studying magic.  After this he passed onto the Middle East and to Europe.  In 1912 he established a base in London and therafter he never paid more than fleeting visits to the United States. ...(New York Times 11/28/55)
Dr. Holdburgh became involved with the Victoria and Albert Museum and became more invoved in collecting.  The fruits of his collecting can be seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum such as English alabasters, Spanish goldsmiths' work, Dutch, German and Italian silver, English sculpture, ivory and Italian bronzes.",15,1876 – 1955,,18052375,,,,,Dr. Walter Leo Hildburgh,,0,0,6882,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052375/,,,,,

"Luca Giordano was born in Naples on October 18, 1632.  As apprentice to his father Antonio Giordano, a painter, Giordano first achieved great distinction for his ability to replicate old masters and quickly earned the nickname 'Proteo della pittura.'  His early works were greatly influenced by the Spanish painter Giuseppe Ribera, but there is no concrete proof that Giordano was, in fact, his pupil.  In 1654, Giordano traveled to Rome for the first time and then continued further to Bologna, Parma, and Venice.  In Venice he became greatly inspired by Titian and Veronese.  From these artists Giordano derived his own distinctly airy and decorative composition as well as an appreciation for vibrant colors.  Giordano is distinguished by his large oevre which expands diverse subject including mythological, religious, historical, battle scenes, still lifes, genre, and portraits.  In 1692, Charles II invited Giordano to Spain.  There he was assigned official Court Painter.  For the next ten years, Giordano executed many great works for the King as well as for the nobility including frescoes for S. Lorenzo, El Escorial; Palacio Real and Buen Retino, Madrid; a Cathedral in Toledo; and a Convent in Quadalupe. In 1702 Giordano returned to Naples.  In 1705 he passed away and was buried at the church of S. Brigida, which he had decorated fifty years prior.  The last three years of his life, Giordano executed some of his most important works including the S. Francesco di Sales; S. Carlo Borromeo for Gerolomini church; and perhaps the most influential: the dome of Certosa di San Martino.  This last work opened the doors to 18th century Rococo decorative style.  His stylisitic legacy was passed down through many followers and pupils as 'Giordanismo.'

"Wendell Castle has been a craftsman, designer, and educator for over four decades.  His work with exotic materials and beautiful hardwoods in biomorphic forms led to the recognition of handcrafted designer furniture as a major art form in the second half of the twentieth century.  In the 1960s he began experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic shapes in his designs.  He created “Environments for Contemplation” in 1969, an iconic object of the psychedelic period: a laminated oak chair in the shape of a womb-like chamber with a door and padded interior. This work was intended as a performance or happening piece rather than a conventional chair. In the 1980’s Castle began to experiment with Postmodernist theory, producing architectural, polychromatic objects.  Each piece is unique, as he is constantly reinventing and improving his craft. Castle developed an innovative way of constructing furniture in a process now called “stack-lamination,” which allows unrestricted sculptural forms to be articulated. Thousands of Castle’s pieces are housed in private, corporate, and permanent museum collections such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. Among his many accolades, Castle has received three honorary doctorate degrees, several grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, and in 2007 he was awarded the Brooklyn Museum’s Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in design.",4,"American, b. 1932",,18050379,,,,7936,Wendell Castle,,0,0,5793,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050379/,58665,113448866,,5117279,23424977

"Keith Haring was born in Reading, PA, 4 May 1958 and raised in the nearby town of Kutztown.  Prior to moving to New York City in 1978, Haring studied art at the Ivy School and The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.  From 1978 to 1980 Haring attended the School of Visual Arts in New York.   Inspired by the graphic strength of graffiti, Haring's ""comic book"" style of drawing developed early in the 1980s when he created iconographic characters which he drew on the subway walls.  Concerned with topics as diverse as AIDS, nuclear holocaust and ecology, Haring employed images of crawling babies, rainbows and barking dogs that serve as emblems of the human condition.  A performance artist, poet and videoartist, Haring made a considerable impact on the East Village art scene in the early 1980s.  He exhibited drawings and paintings in the United States and Europe throughout the 1980s and accepted mural commissions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and New York. He died of AIDS 16 February 1990.",7,"American, 1958 – 1990",,18053541,,,,,Keith Allen Haring,,0,0,7515,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053541/,,,,,23424977

"Alfons Bach was born in Germany in 1904. He studied film directing and design in Europe before coming to the United States in 1926.
Bach settled in the New York metropolitan area. His projects included the remodeling of Sach's furniture store, which occupied the first several floors of the Manhattan's Hoover Building. Bach was responsible for remodeling both the exterior of the building and the interiors of the store. Another major commission was the redesign of the Seneca Textile Building on 34th Street; Bach won an award from the Fifth Avenue Association for his work on this project.
Bach designed and built his own home in Stamford, CT in 1938. Beginning in the late 1940s, he spearheaded a plan for what became on of the first shopping malls in America; the Ridgeway Center of Stamford. Bach designed the entire shopping mall, including many of the individual stores' interiors. The editors of Exhibitor and Theatre Catalog selected Bach's Ridgeway Theatre for their merit award.
After moving to Florida in 1959, Bach continued his design practice. A major project was the Palm Trial Plaza, a marina apartment complex in Delray Beach. Bach was selected to direct the United States exhibits at the 1962 International Industrial Design Exhibition in Paris.
Bach was a noted watercolor painter as well a designer. His paintings were featured in numerous exhibitions in the United States and America.",602,"German, 1904–1999",,18053553,,,,,Alfons Bach,,0,0,7522,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053553/,,,,,23424829

"Metalworker, furniture and industrial designer. Born New York City, September 26, 1909. Wallance             graduated New York University in 1930 with a B.A. in English Literature. He traveled to northern Europe            where he was exposed to the International Style in architecture and design. Upon returning to the United            States, he went to work in his father's furniture store and saw the need for more inventive designs in retail furnishings. He attended Design Laboratory School in New York City from its inception in 1936 until it closed its doors in 1940. From 1941-2, Wallance served as the state of Louisiana's technical and design director for the National Youth Administration, established in 1940 by President Roosevelt to help build a young, technically capable work force. During World War II, Wallance designed mass-produced furniture for servicemen's families living abroad for the Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington. He began designing tableware, cutlery, and accessories for H.E. Lauffer in 1951. 
 Among his most recognizable designs for Lauffer were Design One, a highly sculptural, brushed stainless steel flatware created in 1953, and Design Ten, a colored plastic flatware created in 1978-79. Both designs are now produced by Towle Manufacturing Company. In addition, Wallance designed auditorium seating in steel and upholstered polyurethane foam for Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in 1964 and hospital furniture in steel and plastics for Hard Manufacturing Company in 1965. Wallance is best known for his book, ""Shaping America's Products"", 1956, which remains a seminal study of the relationship of craftsmanship to industry.",1093,"American, 1909 – 1990",,18053597,,,,,Donald A.

"Michelangelo Fasano was an ornamental painter who worked for the Neopolitan court in the mid-18th century.  He is documented to have provided cartoons for the borders, overwindows and supplements for a set of tapestries for the reception rooms near the bedchamber of Charles of Bourbon, King of Naples at the Reggia di Caserta.  These were executed under the direction of Giuseppe Bonito, painter to the Neopolitan court, at the San Carlo al Mortelle (Neopolitan royal manufactory).  The tapestries are now distributed between the Capodimonte Museum and Gallery in Naples, and the Quirinal in Rome.",1,"Italian, active 18th century",,18062091,,,,,Michelangelo Fasano,,0,0,14637,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062091/,,,,,23424853

He studied at l'Ecole des Arts Decoratifs and subsequently pursued studies in London. In 1880 began to work as a freelance jewelry designer in Paris, and by 1882 was designing for Aucoc, Boucheron, Cartier, Destape, Gariod, Hamelin, Jacta, and others. Lalique took over Jules Destapes' jewelry workshop in 1885. In 1892 began to incorporate glass into jewelry, in the form of cast pate-de-verres. Opened his first shop in 1905, and soon after Lalique began designing perfume bottles for Coty. In the same year he rented the Combs-la-Ville glassworks, which was forced to close during World War I. In 1926 began manufacturing vases and statuettes.

"The son of a tailor, Bosse was born in 1602 in Tours, France.  He was active as an engraver in Paris by the age of 20, living on the Ile du Palais.  His earliest works were based on designs of other artists including Jacques Bellange and Jean de Saint-Igny.  The collaborated with Jacques Callot during Callot's stay in Paris in 1629-1631.  By 1625, Bosse was in touch with Melchior Tavernier, the Flemish engraver and printer who until his death in 1641, published many of Bosse's works.  He was a friend of some of the intellectuals of his time.  Pierre Desargues, the mathematician and friend of Descartes, was Bosse's friend.  
     Bosse taught perspective at the Royal Academy of Painting and Scuupture beginning in 1648.  His lectures were published in 1665 as Traité des practiques géomètrales et perspectives... He was made an Honorary academician in 1651, but then after arguments with Charles Le Brun and others, he was excluded from membership.  His views on theory and practive were published in 1667 in Le Peintre converty aux précises et universelles règles de son art.  
     His career falls into two phases.  The first starts in 1622 and runs to 1641, when his publisher Tavernier dies.  From the 1640s on he was active mainly as a writier, illustrator, and sometimes as a publisher, and he made few independent plates.  He appears to become less active as a print maker in his later years.  Bosse seems also to have been active as a painter, though few of his paintings have been identified.",1,"French, 1602–1676",/m/032jjq,18049155,630516,,,,Abraham Bosse,,0,0,5036,500031187,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049155/,60756,61542289,,681834,23424819

"The Daum glassworks began as a bottle factory in Nancy and was acquired in the 1870s by Jean Daum (Verrerie de Nancy).  Production gradually became specialized in fine glassware.  Taken over in 1885-87 by his two sons, Auguste (trained as a lawyer) and Antonin (newly graduated from the École central des arts et manufactures), the firm soon began producing colored glass, and in 1891 opened a decoration studio, employing artists, including Henri Bergé, Eugène Damman, and Jacques Gruber, who created the pieces that were exhibited by the Daum firm at the World Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The Daum works produced layered glass like Emile Gallé’s, and gradually perfected several original and difficult techniques, such as decoration using colored glass powder either fired onto the surface or sealed beneath another layer of glass, wheel cutting, martelage (producing a hammered texture), mold-blowing, etching, and use of applied elements. Two specialties emerged: berluzes (long-necked vases, rising from a low round base) and lamps. In 1906, Daum provided a studio for Almeric Walter, where he produced pâte-de-verre objects.  In the 1920s, the firm’s designs turned to the Art Deco style. Daum continues producing wares to this day, primarily featuring high-end artistic crystal.",8,"founded 1878, Nancy, France",,18049179,1129,,,,Daum,,0,0,5048,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049179/,11207,96555949,,337688,23424819

"Jacques-François Blondel was the father of Georges-François Blondel (ca. 1730-ca. 1790), draughtsman and engraver, and Jean-Baptiste Blondel (1764-1825), architect. He first studied architecture with Jean-François Blondel and later with Gilles Marie Oppenord. He was elected at the Académie royale d'architecture in 1754 or 1755. In 1739 or 1746, Blondel founded his own school of architecture. In 1756 or 1762 he was named professor at the Académie Royale d'Architecture, thus ending his own school.

"Herter Brothers was the foremost American firm in the production of high-quality Renaissance Revival and Aesthetic Movement furniture.  The German-bornHerter Brothers, Christian (1839-1883) and Gustave (1830-1892) Herter, were  highly-skilled craftsmen who worked in New York during the second half of the nineteenth century. Gustave emigrated from Wurttemberg in 1848, and already owned what was a leading cabinet-making and interior decorating company by the time he was joined by Christian in 1859.  Christian became a full partner in what became Herter Brothers in 1864, after which the firm's business greatly expanded.  Despite this, Christian spent some time in France in 1868-9, and in 1870 went to England.  The firm took advantage of the Herters' European training and knowledge of style there to create cosmopolitan interiors and furniture for clients all over the United States, and even in England, as their business developed.",2,"New York, New York, ca. 1865–82",,18062991,,,,,Herter Brothers,,0,0,15252,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062991/,,,,2831913,

excelled at architecture and landscape subjects. He studied first with his father,
Jakob Alt, and received formal training from 1825 to 1832 at the Akademie der
Bildenden Künste, Vienna, where he was later a member. In 1832, his work earned
him a prize, which freed him from military service and allowed him to devote himself fully to art. 

Like his brother, Alt traveled extensively, visiting areas of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and, beginning as early as 1834, exhibited works he had made during these trips in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Dresden, and Paris. He was commissioned by Czar Alexander II in 1863 to execute views of the imperial residences in the Crimea. The Lanckoronski watercolors are two of a series of ten completed for a commission by Count Karol Lanckoronski (1848–1933) of his residence prior to the construction of the Palais Lanckoronski in 1894–95. A well-known and soughtafter artist, Alt was ennobled in 1882, and in 1897 was nominated honorary president of the Vienna Secession by Gustav Klimt.

noble family forced into exile during the political upheavals of the nineteenth century. A friend of Charles de Talleyrand, Fredro would have been about sixteen
years old in 1836 when A Room in the Reuss Palace, Dresden was completed. Another drawing in the Thaw Collection, A Room in a Florentine Palace, came from an album which may have been assembled by Fredro’s sister and originally contained a number of his drawings. He seemed to have a talent for caricature; comical drawings record a visit that he made in 1848 with Talleyrand to Rochecotte, the French château belonging to the Marquise de Castellane.

"William Henry Hunt began studying with John Varley (1778–1842), draftsman and
founding member in 1804 of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Evidence of
this tutelage is apparent in Hunt’s early landscapes, genre scenes, and architectural studies. In 1806, Hunt showed at the Royal Academy and enrolled for formal study the following year. Early in his career, he found employment by painting views of gentleman’s country seats, of which the Cassiobury drawing is one example. Hunt worked primarily in watercolor and first exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1814, joining as a full member in 1826. He is best known for his still lifes, for which the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin called him “the good peach and apple painter” in 1879 (Treble, Rosemary. ""Hastings.

In the 1840s, Richardson drew and painted the treasures at Goodrich Court for the noted collector Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, thus feeding his antiquarian inclinations. The studies include specimens of unusual early furniture and objects as well as rooms from ancient houses. He exhibited seventeen works at the Royal Academy, including views of the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, Holland House, and Sutton Place.

"Jules-Frédéric Bouchet was an architect and engraver who began his career as a
student of French architect and designer Charles Percier (1764–1838). In 1822,
Bouchet obtained second prize in the Grand Prix of architecture for his design
of an opera-house interior. While he lived and worked in Paris, Bouchet was
enamored with Italian ruins and antiquities. After a trip to study them from 1825
to 1828, he completed twenty-seven engraved illustrations of the Maison du
poète tragique `a Pomp’ei (The House of the Tragic Poet at Pompeii), one of the first major studies of a Pompeiian house. Upon his return to Paris, he was named  Inspector of the Works of the Royal Library (later the Bibliothèque Nationale) under
Ludovico-Tullio-Giacomo Visconti (1791–1853). Bouchet was also named Inspector of the Tomb of Napoleon, and finally was appointed chief architect of the tomb project after Visconti’s death. Bouchet actively showed at numerous salons from the 1830s through the 1850s.

"Eduard Petrovich Hau was first trained in painting by his father, the landscape
painter Johannes Hau (1771–1838), and was a student at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Dresden, for one year. In 1836, he went to Dorpat, a center of romanticism in the nineteenth century, and worked as a portraitist. There
he began a catalogue of portraits of thirty professors at the Imperial Universities of
Dorpat known as the Sammlung von Portraits der Professoren an der Kaiserlichen
Universität zu Dorpat seit dem Jahre 1837 nach dem Leben und auf Stein gezeichnet von E. Hau. Ultimately, Hau moved to Saint Petersburg, where he was hired in 1852 to assist with a significant nine-year documentation of the interiors of the New Hermitage, contributing twenty paintings to the total of fifty-five views.

"Emmanuel de Coulange, or Coulange-Lautrec, was born in Nîmes, France. He
took courses in architecture and decoration in Marseille and returned there in
1877 as a professor of industrial and decorative arts at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1856 and also worked as an illustrator of
deluxe publications for a firm in Saint-Germain-des-Près. Coulange-Lautrec completed several designs for mural paintings in churches, mansions, and
châteaux in the south of France as well as in the Grand Salon of the Marseille Stock Exchange. He is known for his landscape paintings of Provence and for his still lifes, which show a great admiration for Dutch masters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

"H. Zweigenthal (former name used in Berlin, Germany).  

Notes from visit of 7/1/02, by son Antony Herrey and German architect Thomas Katzke who planning to write a book on H. Herrey:

The architect Hermann Herrey was born in Vienna, Austria (4/4/1904) and died in New York (10/10/1968).  He was in London in 1938, when the Anschlus occured in Austria.  He gave up his Austrian citizenship and made his way to the U.S., ca. 1940*.  Herrey became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in 1946, and was based in New York.

He was not a member of the Baushaus, but knew and worked with Bauhaus architects.  He designed the first high-rise garage in Germany.  The garage still exists, located on Kant Strasse in Berlin.  Among his other works are:  a prefabricated house for the Berlin exhibition ""Das Wachsende Haus;"" a Berlin shoe store; the Arthur Schnitzler House [Architecture Review Supplement (U.K., 1936]; shop interior with built-in glass vitrine in the Jacoby 1872 building, Frankfurt (1929-30); stage/set designs for the London production of Faustus; the Morgenthau house, Long Island; concepts for landfill use in New York (example: Battery Park City).

Re: photos of donor's (Ruth Vollmer) Berlin appartment, showing furniture by Herrey in situ. These were taken by Umbo (photographer's stamp on backs of photos), a bauhaus photographer who documented many Bauhaus designers and architects (Gropius, Mies, others).  (photos are in object file 1982-26-6a,b)

Herrey's papers are in the Crock library at Cornell University.

*note: the boat carrying Herrey's possessions to the U.S. was sunk by a German U-boat.  All of Herrey's things, including many papers and his drawings for the London production of Faustus, went down with the ship.",3,"American, 1904–1968",,18049345,,,,,Hermann Zweigenthal Herrey,,0,0,5168,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049345/,,,,,23424829

"Mabel Sarton was born near London, but lived and worked in Zurich and Belgium during her early years. She went to art school in London and exhibited often, winning prizes for her miniature painting. While living in Ghent, she launched a successful career designing furniture and interiors. Unfortunately, her success was stopped short by the outbreak of World War I, and in 1915, she and her husband, George Sarton, who became a Harvard professor, moved to the United States. They settled in Cambridge, but it took Mabel a long time to reach the success she had achieved while in Europe.",1,"English, 1881–1950",,18049399,,,,,Mabel Sarton,,0,0,5203,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049399/,,,,,23424975
"Cuban-born, Brooklyn-raised Art Smith was one of the major modernist jewelers of the mid-twentieth century. He attended Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art from 1942 to 1946 where he first pursued architectural studies but eventually abandoned them to concentrate on sculpture and the manipulation of three-dimensional forms. During the early 1940s he learned jewelry making while working part-time as a crafts supervisor at the Children’s Aid Society, and through a night course at New York University. He also worked for and was influenced by Winifred Mason, an African-American jewelry designer with a store in Greenwich Village.  In 1946, Smith opened his first store, also in Greenwich Village. Inspired by surrealism, biomorphism, and primitivism, Smith’s jewelry included large scale, asymmetrical forms made from hand-hammered elements of silver, copper, or brass, sometimes combined with quartz or other colorful stones. His jewelry explored organic shapes and both positive and negative space on several planes. Whatever the form, Smith was continually concerned with the jewelry’s relationship to the human body. He considered his jewelry as an incomplete sculptural expression until it was related to the body. An African-American, he also made reference to his roots through his use of symbols reminiscent of those used in African tribal jewelry.",2,"American, 1917–1982",,18049319,,,,,Art Smith,,0,0,5143,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049319/,,,,15662313,23424977

"One of the most influential graduates of the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, Hungarian-born Marcel Breuer was a protégé of Bauhaus director, architect Walter Gropius. After graduating in 1924, Breuer was invited back to become master of the carpentry workshop at the new Bauhaus quarters in Dessau. From 1925-28, aside from his teaching duties, he created a series of innovative modernist tubular steel furniture designs recognized for their light, sturdy and rational construction and manufacture. His later designs for aluminum furniture won first prize at the 1934 Paris international competition for the best aluminum chair. Uncertain of continuing work in Europe, Breuer moved to England in 1935 to form a partnership with English architect F.S.R. Yorke. To supplement his practice, Breuer also started to design plywood furniture for the new Isokon Furniture Company.  Breuer’s mentor Gropius, who moved to England in 1934, was also a part of the venture, and from its beginning he wanted Breuer to create designs for the firm given his previous experience creating innovative furniture. In 1937, Breuer settled in the United States and joined the faculty of Harvard University School of Design, again under the leadership of  Walter Gropius, who left England the year before. During the next 40 years in America, Breuer combined a modernist style with local materials, designing furniture for his own interiors and continuing to experiment with plywood.

"Ohr was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, on July 12, 1857.  The self-styled “mad potter of Biloxi” is known especially for his unique ability to create very thin-walled vases on a potter’s wheel and his various techniques for distorting a piece’s shape—e.g., twisting the vase to make an undulating pattern, flattening the opening in segments to get a pie crust effect, pinching the rim and bending it in a bunched ribbon effect, etc.  In 1881-2, starting in New Orleans, Ohr hopped on freight trains and stopped in 16 states to visit every potter he could find.  In 1883, in Biloxi, he built his first pottery. A prolific worker, he is said to have created over 10,000 pots in his lifetime.  Ohr died on April 7, 1918 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",9,"American, 1857–1918",/m/058xw_,18044085,,,,4384,George  E.

"Trude Guermonprez started weaving in Halle, Germany at the Municipal School of Arts and Crafts. Her family emigrated to the United States in 1939. After war, Trude did freelance work in Holland, where her husband, photographer Paul Guermonprez, was killed while serving in the Dutch Underground. Six years of weaving in a Dutch rug shop preceded her coming to America, at the invitation of Anni Albers, to teach at Black Mountain College, and later to northern California to join her friend, Marguerite Wildenhain, at Pond Farm Workshops in a producing-teaching cooperative in Guerneville.Then, she moved to San Francisco with her new husband, the craftsman-builder John Elsesser, and worked there becoming Chairman of the Craft Department at The California College of Arts and Crafts. In Studio One at the Oakland College she helped young people approach her artistry.Though she has designed fabrics for New York textile manufacturers, her works were mainly custom produced for architects and individuals.

"Hitoshi Ujiie, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and worked in his family's textile business, is a textile designer as well as educator and founder of the Center for Excellence in Digital Inkjet Printing at Philadelphia University. He received a B.F.A from Kyoto Seika University in Japan and a M.F.A from the University of Georgia. Ujiie’s work is an exploration of the aesthetic implications of digital inkjet printing for textiles, which is bringing about profound changes in the approach to design for this medium. 
Working from photographic and video sources combined with hand manipulation, Ujiie exploits the full range of effects that can be achieved by digital technology, yet his work maintains a profoundly delicate aesthetic. Digital technology permits a fineness of line not previously possible due to the higher “resolution” of inkjet vs. screen technology. It also eliminates the need for repeat in textile design, and Ujiie turns his attention instead to a sense of movement without repetition.",4,"American, b.

"Edward Mcnight Kauffer was born in Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana on 14 December 1890. He grew up in the small town of Evansville on the Ohio River in Indiana, where the Kauffer grandparents had settled. After the divorce of their parents, he spent two years in an orphanage. By the age of four or five he had begun to draw. His mother remarried in 1899. Kauffer left school at the age of 12 or 13 to be helper to the scene painter in the City Directory. In the Elder Bookshop and Art Rooms in San Francisco Kauffer acquired not only a speaking voice of marked attractiveness and distinction but also a life-long passion for books. He continued his studies as a painter by receiving his first formal training at evening sessions at the Mark Hopkins Institute. He met Professor McKnight, who became his patron; in homage to him Kauffer adopted the name of McKnight. A small exhibition of Kauffer's paintings was held at the Elder Art Rooms. From 1912 to 1913 he was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. Kauffer reached Paris in the autumn of 1913. On July 1914 he married an American concert pianist, Grace Ehrlich, and together, they left for England. Kauffer had tried over 25 London companies unsuccessfully when he met Frank Pick, the Publicity Manager of the London Underground Electric Railways. The first posters for the London Underground Railways appeared in 1915. Over the next 25 years the company became his major client and he their major posters artist. During the five years period 1916-1921 Kauffer was an increasingly exhibited painter who seemed to be at home with all of the different, and sometimes warring, elements of the English avant-garde, but he was also an increasingly successful designer. A more interesting commission for which Kauffer produced designs throughout this period was initiated by the Manchester textile company Steinthal & Company A.P. Simon.
Kauffer regularly provided posters, sets and costumes for the Art League of Service, founded in London in 1919. He's career as a painter finished in 1920 with his resignation from the London Group, the failure of X Group. In 1921 he was sufficiently in funds to attempt to establish himself as a designer in New York. He returned to London in the spring of 1922. On his return Kauffer resumed work on a set of posters commissioned by Pick to advertise the principal museums in London. Others clients in this period were Gerald Meynell and Cyril Eastman. It was probably a useful step for Kauffer to join Sir William Crawford's agency, which was alive to continental developments in graphic design.
In the thirties Kauffer became a very public figure in Britain. In this period many exhibitions of Kauffer's works were held England.
He worked for Cresta Silk and Orient Line. Peter Gregory was one sheet-anchor for Kauffer in the thirties, Jack Beddington was another and made most of his new opportunities. Kauffer's collaboration with Ninette de Valois and Arthur Bliss to create Checkmate in 1937 was his first and last triumph in the theatre.

"Anna Alma-Tadema began her artistic training at a very young age under the tutelage of her father, Dutch-born painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836–1912). Anna was the youngest daughter from her father’s first marriage. After his wife’s death in 1869, Alma-Tadema married one of his pupils, Laura Thèrése Epps, who became a respected artist. Anna Alma-Tadema’s debut seems to have been at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1885, where two studies she submitted were “indicative of much promise” (New York Times, May 17, 1885). Another view of Townshend House in Regent’s Park, London, may have been painted prior to 1885, when Alma-Tadema and his family moved to the house formerly owned by James Tissot in Grove End Road, in St. John’s Wood.

"Alexandre Benois was a painter, watercolorist, illustrator, and writer best known
for his stage décor and costume designs for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. The
son and grandson of court architects, Benois was brought up within the Russian
imperial entourage. His father worked at Peterhof and later at Pavlovsk, and was
responsible for the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow and the Mariinsky Theatre in St.
Petersburg (Crisp, Clement. ""Alexandre Nikolaevich Benois,"" in Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 13, no. 2, 1995: 47-48). 

Benois first began his study of painting in St. Petersburg between 1887 and 1888, and from 1891 to about 1910 he participated in exhibitions of the Society of Russian Watercolorists. Around 1898, Benois founded the magazine Mir Iskousstva (The World of Art) with Diaghilev and Léon Bakst. In 1909, at the same time he was designing for the Ballets Russes, he exhibited a suite of paintings entitled Promenade de Louis XIV dans le parc de Versailles. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Benois continued to be engaged in the fine arts. He served as director of the Picture Gallery of the Hermitage Museum from 1917 until he left Russia for Paris in 1926.

"Joris Laarman (b. 1979) has had a meteoric rise in the design profession since his years at the Eindhoven Design Academy.  While still a student there he designed as his thesis project the Heat Wave Radiator (featured in Cooper-Hewitt's Rococo exhibition and subsequently acquired for the collection, 2008-13-1-a/c).  Upon graduation in 2003, he started his own company, Joris Laarman Studio, focusing on product design and architecture.  Laarman is particularly interested in working at the intersection of science and aesthetics.  Before 2007, he came across the work of a German scientist, Claus Metthek, who developed an algorithm (based on the regenerative structure of bones which allows them to add and subtract matter as needed) for the Opal car company, which enabled them to produce car parts that were optimized for strength and minimal materials use.  He applied a form of this technology to produce his break-through Bone Chair which debuted at the Milan Furniture Fair in 2007 and the following year was featured in MoMA’s exhibition Design and the Elastic Mind.  Since his 2010 solo exhibition at Friedman Benda Gallery (his first in the US), Laarman has been working with Renny Ramakers (Droog) and Michiel Frackers on MakeMe (a combination on-line store and virtual lab) where people can order up designs for modeling by prototyping and fabricated locally by approved manufacturers.",2,"Dutch, b. 1979",,18060585,,,,,Joris Laarman,,0,0,13466,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060585/,,,,,23424909

"Mary Ellen Best was born in York, England, the younger of two daughters of
well-to-do doctor Charles Best and his wife Mary. Her father died when she was
eight, and left a bequest to both children, guaranteeing in some measure their freedom to pursue an education and not be forced into marriage for financial support as adults. 

Mary Ellen and her sister Rosamond attended boarding school and were both likely taught painting privately prior to their lessons with George Haugh (1755–1827), a successful painter who exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy (Davidson, Caroline. The World of Mary Ellen Best. London: Chatto & Windus, 1985: 16). Best lived with her mother after her schooling, and they often traveled together through England, Germany, and the Netherlands. Family documents indicate that Mary Ellen was actively painting watercolors and selling her works as early as 1831. After the 1850s, she seems to have given up painting. She recorded her career by pasting a number of her best paintings chronologically into albums; nearly all of these albums have now been dispersed.

seven, he was brought to live with relatives in New York. He began studying art
at fourteen with Walter Oddie (1808–1865), a landscape painter and early
member of the National Academy of Design. Henry furthered his study with Paul
Weber (1823–1916) at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and in Paris as a
student of Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797–1890) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
He later traveled through Rome and Florence. In 1859, Henry began exhibiting
yearly at the National Academy of Design; two years later he received the status of
full Academician. From 1875 to 1879, Henry lived in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy and Suffolk Street Gallery, and exhibited at both the 1878 and 1889 Expositions Universelles, receiving an honorable mention for his submission to the latter. After returning to the United States, he spent summers in a small artist/farming community in upstate New York known as Cragsmoor, which frequently appeared as the subject of his landscape and genre paintings from the late 1870s onward.

"Dorothy Wright Liebes’ career began as a school teacher, a practical profession for women in the early 20th century. After some years teaching school, she turned to the arts, something she had always found inspiring. Liebes enrolled in art classes at Berkeley in 1919 and received her B.A. cum laude in Applied Design in 1922. She first pursued her career in what was then the center of the textile industry, New York City, knocking on doors and selling her work to important companies, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Goodall Fabric Company.  
Her marriage to A. H. Liebes Department Store heir, Leon, allowed her the freedom of doing what she wanted, which was to set up her own studio. Inspired by the city’s Chinatown, Dorothy Liebes incorporated red lacquer into her work. She also studied Scandinavian weaving techniques and combined a variety of materials, such as silk, linen, cellophane, and cork. Heavily influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and his Arts and Crafts movement, Liebes began producing weaves that drew from the natural environment and paid close attention to how light affected those colors’ tones. Liebes traveled to Guatemala in 1936. This 3-month journey gave her new perspective on color and design, and she brought back native motifs with Spanish influences and pre-Columbian textiles. She had cemented her aesthetic, consisting of combining manmade fibers to her textiles along with metallic elements. 
She was named Director of the 1939 Decorative Arts Exhibition in San Francisco, and used this position to turn the world’s attention to craft. As National Director of the Red Cross Arts and Skills Program, she and others trained war veterans to weave giving them a practical skill guaranteeing them jobs in the booming textile industry.
In the 1930s, Hollywood gave Liebes a chance to have a greater impact on American taste, when she was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to design curtains for movie sets. Simultaneously, her hand-woven fabrics were being collected and exhibited at fine art museums, such as the Palace of Fine Arts in San Diego.
By the 1940s, Liebes was approached by companies to evolve her designs into machine-woven textiles. Eventually, she opened her own corporation, Dorothy Liebes Textiles, and began working with many of the leading architecture firms designing and producing patterns and textiles. She continued to travel and is known today to be a pioneer of the textile industry for her innovate use of color and material.",162,"American, 1897–1972",,18045817,,,,,Dorothy Wright Liebes,,0,0,2809,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045817/,,,,,23424977

"Ladislav Sutnar , bohemian painter and advertising, display, and industrial designer. 
He studied at the School of Industrial Arts and at the Technical University and at the Charles University in Prague. 
At the early age of 26 Sutnar became a professor of design at the State School for Graphic Arts, also in Prague.
A pioneering designer, he worked as a painter and stage designer, becoming one of the most notable exhibition designers of the 1930s. His most important designs included 1930-1932 glass drinking set, 1928-1932 china table set, and cutlery. In 1930 Sutnar produced designs for porcelains dinnerware and, in 1931, heat-resistant cups, tea sets, and containers for Schone Stube in Prague. 
As the exhibition architect of the Czechoslovak government, he was chief designer of the Czechoslovak Hall at the Czech pavilion at the 1939-40 ""New York World's Fair"". Arriving in the United States in 1939, he embarked upon a prolific career comprising typography, packaging, and advertising and exhibition design.
In 1941 he became art director, coordinator and designer of the format of ""Sweet's Files"", a set of annually updated catalogues of industrial and architectural products. Sutnar showed designers how to cope with complex information, using visual articulation of type - underlining, type-size and weight contrast, spacing, color, and reversing - to facilitate searching, scanning, and reading.
Since 1951 he had his own company known as ""Sutnar-Office"", which was located on East 37th Street for many years; in recent years it was located on East 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York City and in Cincinnati.
Sutnar was also art director of Theatre Arts Magazine. He also wrote articles and published a numbers of books, among them are: ""Design for Point of Sale"" (1952), ""Package Design: The Force of Visual Selling"" (1953), and ""Visual Design in Action: Principles, Purposes"" (1961). At the same time Sutnar did not neglet his painting, starting a long series of his  famous Venuses, prototypes of American woman in various moods and situations, always happy, tasteful and humorous.
Sutnar won a gold medal at the 1929-30 ""Exposition Internacional de Barcelona"", grand prize at the 1936 (VI) ""Triennale di Milano"", and 14 grand prizes and gold medals at the 1937 ""Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne"". He was elected an honorary member of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America in 1970.
During the last years of his life Sutnar struggled often with financial problems. He died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City , November 18th, 1976.

Ladislav Sutnar (1897-1976) was one of the foremost designers of information graphics, and an accomplished author and designer who wrote about and demonstrated the new corporate requirements for “strength in visual unity”. He developed graphic systems for a variety of businesses clarifying vast amounts of complex information using sometimes little more than common punctuation and lower-case sans serif type.  

Born in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia he studied at the Prague School of Decorative Arts and Czech Technical University. In 1923 he became professor of design at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague, ultimately becoming director in 1932, and kept this title even after emigrating to the United States in 1939. Between 1941 and 1960 he was the art director for F.W. Dodge’s Sweet’s Catalog Service, America’s leading distributor and producer of trade and manufacturing catalogues, for which he created a “navigational” system using icons and typographical devices that allowed users to review quantities of information quite easily. In 1951 he opened his own office in New York and had clients such as Bell System, for whom he designed the parentheses that enclose the area code, and he also worked for Vera scarves and Addo-x Inc., a Swedish business machine company that was competing with Olivetti in the United States. It is for the latter company that Sutnar designed exhibitions and created a bold graphic identity demonstrating his special capacity for the design of graphic symbols.",46,"American, b.

"Engraver, etcher, printmaker and publisher, son of (1) Theodor de Bry. He was the most prolific printmaker of the family, practising both engraving and etching. With his father and his brother Johann Israel, he published two popular emblem books: Emblemata nobilitate et vulgo scitu digna (Frankfurt am Main, 1593; Paris, 1895) and Emblemata secularia (Oppenheim, 1611). With his brother he also published the design of a grotesque and quasi-erotic human alphabet (Hollstein, nos 119–69). His independent work includes reproductive engravings after such masters as Titian, Marten de Vos, Abraham Bloemaert and Sebald Beham.

"Verner Panton was born in Denmark in 1926, he studied at the Technical College from 1944-47, and then studied architecture at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen from 1947-1951. Panton lived and worked most of his life in Basel, Switzerland, where by the mid-1950s he was an internationally acclaimed interior architect and designer. His most decisive influence was the Danish designer Poul Henningsen who was known for his lighting design and key figure in 20th century Danish design, and who became Panton’s mentor. He also admired the work of Arne Jacobsen, and worked in his office form 1950-52. At this time Jacobsen was one of Denmark’s leading architects, and though he built relatively few buildings, Panton referred to himself as both an architect and designer. 

Panton loved to experiment with his work. Some of his greatest designs came from toying with different materials, production techniques, traditional design, as well as manipulating light and color. Color is one of Panton’s trademarks, as well as the central element of his design. He studied the physics of light and published a booklet, Notes of Colour, in 1997. He was constantly searching for innovations in all areas of design. He started to create rooms as environments in 1960 beginning with a hotel and restaurant in Trondheim, Norway. He reached his pinnacle in 1970 with the legendary Visiona 2 exhibition in Cologne, which was commissioned by the Bayer chemical company. Panton’s comprehensive approach to design as well as the design of radical environments was then emulated by designers like Pierre Paulin and Joe Colombo. 

As mentioned, color  was a central element in all of Verner Panton’s designs for interiors and furniture, and in particular, textiles, which became his most important vehicle for color in the futurist environments for which Panton is best known. When Panton left Jacobsen’s office in 1952, he traveled throughout Europe introducing designs for chairs, lighting, and textiles to a number of companies and obtaining commissions mainly for Danish projects. In 1968 Panton was commissioned by the paint and fiber manufacturer, Bayer, to design an environment at the Cologne Furniture Fair using synthetic fibers and materials.  Intended as an annual series of exhibitions to take place on a boat, Panton advised Bayer to call it Visiona. For Visiona 0 in 1968, the futurist environment was referred to as the Dralon Boat, and included furniture, lighting, and textiles, a combination which caused a visually interesting and an almost dizzying effect. 

The Anatomical Designs, which included Lippen, were initially part of Visiona 0 from 1968. Round rooms of various colors were bedecked with draperies and round floor carpets on which were printed large photorealist representations of hands, feet, mouths, eyes and ears. The model for these body parts was his wife, Marianne. Later, the Swiss textile company, Mira-X, produced these designs under the name of Anatomic. The Visiona series continued until the mid-1970s under Panton’s leadership and featured such illustrious designers as Joe Colombo.  However, it soon featured only home textiles rather than presenting Panton’s idea of a model living environment, where every new technical innovation in the field of synthetic materials was put to use.  


Panton began a long-term collaboration with the Swiss textile manufacturer, Mira-X, in 1969.  Panton’s collections for Mira-X were based on his idea of an integral concept of living, and a vision of colored space. Many of these textiles also represented Panton’s love for experimentation with form, material, and production techniques.  Every fabric was a variation on the initial collection, which was based on a limited number of geometric patterns and only eight pure colors with additional tonal variations. The number of colors and patterns grew over time, but by the 1980s Mira-X ceased to manufacture Panton textiles, and the interest in his work waned. 

In addition to textiles, the Cooper-Hewitt currently has the stacking side chair (1977-1-1) and Cone chair (1986-99-44) by Panton. Lippen represents some of his strongest work designed at the pinnacle of his career, and since it is an earlier textile design, is more in keeping with the 1959-60 design of the chairs. The Cooper-Hewitt also has in its collection seven textiles from 1983 produced by Mira-X, which one of his more innovative and unusual fabrics produced during the early 1970s, Finesse: Circle (2011-36-2), a printed textile with areas of burn out within the circles. This created a semi-translucent textile that when held up to the light would have created a very dappled light and feeling of three-dimensionality. Finesse designs also included Square and Curve.",11,"Danish, 1926–1998",/m/02gc67,18045471,,,,4485,Verner Panton,,0,0,2623,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045471/,31520,116681603,,487018,23424796

While working in visual merchandising for Nordstrom Corporate Visual Merchandising, she received the assignment of producing a large number of felt sculptures for window displays. She traveled to Central Asia to try to source the material there, learned the felt-making process from the local women, and has been working exclusively in felt ever since.

"Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979) was a modern artist and designer who merged art and everyday life. Her work encompassed everything from paintings and drawings, painted ceramics, and neon light sculpture to posters, textiles, and costume designs. Born in 1885 as Sarah Stern to a Jewish laborer’s family in Gradizhsk, Ukraine, she was adopted at the age of five by her maternal uncle, Henri Terk, a wealthy lawyer in St. Petersburg.  Showing artistic talent in her youth, she attended an art academy in Germany and later went to Paris where she ultimately met her husband, Robert Delaunay, also a painter.  Together they developed the theory of Simultaneity, which is the sensation of movement when placing contrasting colors side by side, and is very much expressed in their paintings as well as in the textiles that Sonia Delaunay designed in the 1920s.",2,"French, born Russia, 1885 - 1979",,18063163,,,,1480,Sonia Delaunay,,0,0,15394,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063163/,,,,1945951,23424819

"Helena Hernmarck was born in Stockholm, and trained at Stockholm Collect of Arts, Crafts, and Design.
In 1964 she moved to Canada where she was inspired by pop culture, and began producing sculptural public tapestries with spun and dyed yarns from Sweden. She produced large-scale black and white pieces that resembled newspapers. Rather than use the Gobelin technique, she “uses as background a discontinuous plain weave on top of which she hand picks a supplementary pattern weft, according to a grid which at one end totally covers the plain weave (soumac stitch) and allows it to become increasingly exposed” (Sigrid Wortmann Weltge, “Helena Hernmarck,” American Craft (December 1999/January 2000). While the size of her works looks to medieval tapestries, the subject matter is modern and ignores the idea that a tapestry should be flat. Instead, Hernmarck embraces three-dimensionality through color, shadow, and imagery.",1,"Swedish, active Sweden and United States, b. 1941",,18059707,,,,2614,Helena Hernmarck,,0,0,12906,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18059707/,,53791961,,,

"American designer, Lester Beall (1903-1969), was educated at Lane Technical School in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree in art history from the University of Chicago. 
Upon discovering the work of the European avant-garde, Beall was inspired to bring American design of the 1930s and 1940s to a higher level of effective visual communication. Self-taught, Lester Beall was one of the first Americans to have his work shown in a German monthly graphics periodical, ""Gebrauchsgraphik"", and was one of the first Americans to incorporate the New Typography, using techniques such as the photomontage, collage and the use of cut-out flat colored paper in combination with photography and economical line drawing, reworking the element of European modernism into a distinctive American style. He produced solutions to graphic design problems that were unique among his American contemporaries.
Beall moved from Chicago to New York City in 1935 and did much work that was influential to the field of editorial design. In 1937 Beall became the first American commercial artist to be honored with one-man show at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Between 1938 and 1940, Beall redesigned twenty magazines for McGraw Hill, in 1946 he designed two covers for ""Fortune"" and in 1944 he began designing ""Scope"" magazine for Upjohn Pharmaceuticals which he did until 1951. In 1952, Beall opened a design office in Dumbarton farm, his home in rural Connecticut. In 1973, four years after his death, Lester Beall was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame.
Philip B. Meggs credits Beall with ""almost single-handedly launching the modern movement in American design"". In 1973, the Art Directors Club of New York belatedly elected him to its prestigious Hall of Fame. Bob Plisken, who worked for Beall in the early 1940s, said on that occasion, ""In my opinion, Beall did more than anyone to make graphic design in America a distinct and respected profession"".",2,1909–1969,/m/02rttp4,18048993,,,,409,Lester Beall,,0,0,4925,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048993/,,,,11827072,23424977

"In 1877, at the age of 26, Doat joined the National Manufactory of Sevres.  His speciality was pate-sur-pate decoration and flambe, crystalline and metallic glazes. Doat also wrote the ceramic textbook, Grand Feu Ceramics, that was translated into English by Samuel Robineau.  In 1909, he arrived in the U.S. to work as the Director of the School of Ceramic Art at the Art Institute and the University City Pottery in Missouri.  Under his guidance, University City Pottery  flourished.  University City Pottery work was exhibited at the International Exposition of 1911 in Turin, Italy where it was awarded the Grand Prize in competition with all the European potteries.  After a reorganization of  University City Pottery in 1912, Doat stayed on as director.  Production at University City Pottery ended by early 1915.  Doat returned to France in 1915 and died there in May 1938.

"Born in Paris and woked in Rome from about 1845 to 1898.  He was most well-known for his jewelry in the Etruscan style.  
""Pierret is first recorded as a working jeweller, of 55 via Borgogna, though no initial is given, in Murray's Handbook for Central Italy and Rome of 1850.  By the  1853 edition, his address, still with no initial, is given as 31 Piazza di Firenze, with the comment the he is 'now one of the first artists in Rome for Etruscan jewellery, and is more moderate in his charges than Castellani'.  The Libro Per Turri, an artistic and commercial guide to Rome of 1866, records Ernesto Pierret at 36 via dell' Umilta, but the Murray Handbook to Rome of 1867 records Pierret at 20 Piazza di Spagna and describes him as 'only second to Castellani'.  He remained at this address until the late 1890s when he no longer appears in the guidebooks or directories.  At some point prior to 1884, however, the business appears to have been taken over by Luigi Pierret, presumable a son, who exhibited 'archaeological-style' jewellry at the Turin Exhibition of 1884.""

"Established by Elbert Hubbard (1856 - 1915) in 1895, the Roycroft community was located in East Aurora, New York.  An Arts and Crafts community centered around a series of workshops, it employed up to 500 people at its peak. The workshops produced furniture, bookbindings and metalwork. Hubbard was ""an apostle of aestheticism"" and authored books on the relationshiop between the arts and life. Karl Kipp was selected by Hubbard to organize and direct the Roycroft copper shop, and by 1910 the workshop was in full production.  Kipp was assisted in this endeavor by Walter Jennings.  
In 1911, they left to start their own firm, The Tookay Shop, but in 1915 were persuaded to return by Elbert Hubbard II, who had succeeded his father after the death of his parents in the Lusitania disaster in 1915.  The wares were originally sold through gift shops and mail order, but Hubbard II decided to establish retail displays in major department stores.  By 1924, there were more than 320 retail outlets nationwide.  The firm's sales were drastically cut due to the Depression, and the Roycroft Shops formally declared bankruptcy in 1938.  Some of the early designs from the shop use motifs which were reminiscent of Viennese Secessionist designs, especially the work of Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser for the Wiener Werkstätte.  These designs were familiar to Dard Hunter, who had travelled to Vienna in 1908, and began incorporating Secessionist designs into his stained glass designs upon his return to the Roycroft community in 1909.  Karl Kipp and Dard Hunter collaborated on some lamps for the 1910 catalog and Hunter's designs probably influenced Kipp's work.",2,"East Aurora, NY, 1895 – 1938",,18055919,,,,,Roycroft Shops,,0,0,10540,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055919/,,,,,23424977

"TAR/Tillett and Rauscher Inc., founded in 2006 by Seth Tillett and Nicole Rauscher, is an experimental textile hand-printing studio in Harlem. Tillett comes from a long line of calico printers in England, and grew up in his parents’ live/work studio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His parents, D.D. and Leslie Tillett, of Tillett Fabrics Inc., produced custom textiles for the Jackie Kennedy White House, Babe Paley, and other influential clients. They were also artists and experimenters, and developed a number of unique printing techniques, such as the drag-box, a hand-made tool for creating stripes and plaids without the use of a screen. 
Seth Tillett has worked extensively in film, dance and theater as a dramaturge, set and lighting designer, in addition to creating installations. In 2000, he met Nicole Rauscher, a dancer and choreographer, and the two began collaborating on installations and performances involving graphics and textiles. In 2003, the pair moved to New York City, and Rauscher apprenticed herself to D.D. (Doris) Tillett for the last years of her life, while running Tillett Fabrics. Rauscher continues to print Tillett Fabrics designs on request for interior designers who have been clients for decades, but in 2006, Seth and Nicole founded TAR to develop their own experimental approaches. The resulted in a range of techniques that are so hand-intensive and the results so unique that they call into question the use of the term printing, which implies fast, cheap repetition. By creating tools and techniques with which the design is created directly on the fabric, the pair actively seeks to create non-repeating, non-repeatable patterns which embrace spontaneity and chance.",4,"American, founded 2006",,18065075,,,,,TAR/Tillett and Rauscher Inc.,,0,0,16526,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065075/,,,,,23424977

His interest in language, words, images, and typography, became the impetus for the creation of his own design firm. M & Co. was known for its innovative use of images and type to create imaginative and witty designs. Many prominent figures in the field got their start with M & Co., including Stephen Doyle, Alexander Isley, Bethany Johns, Marlene McCarty, and Emily Oberman. During its 14-years history, the company worked on a variety of projects from videos and album covers to stationery and ID systems. Clients included Hannibal Records, the Talking Heads, the Memphis real-estate agency, the Restaurant Florent and the China Grill in New York, the National Audubon Society, Benetton, Swatch, and NYNEX. M & Co. created the title sequences for movies including Jonathan Demme's ""Something Wild"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and David Byrne's ""True Stories"". In addition, M & Co., created its own line of products, among them an architectural paperweight made of rigid vinyl and lead, mimicking a crumpled piece of blueprint paper, and a line of timepieces with nontraditional faces. Among their better known timepieces are the ""10-1-4"" watch, whose face has only the numbers 10, 1, and 4, in their appropriate places; the ""Onomatopoeia"" watch, where certain digits are replaced by symbols, such as a  hand representing the number five; the ""Bug"" watch, where numerals were replaced with a variety of insect symbols; and the ""Askew"" watch, whose digits appeared on the face in random order. Kalman identifies his wife Maira, herself a noted artist and children's author, as ""an important collaborator"". Kalman dissolved the company in 1992. At that time he donated the company's administrative and project files to the museum. Kalman moved to Rome in 1993 to edit Benetton'magazine, ""Colors"". Subsequently, he returned to New York to work independently.",340,1979–1993,,18048717,,,,,M & Co.,,0,0,4716,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048717/,,,,,23424977

"Finnish fabric manufacturer and retail chain. The company's chief designer was Armi Ratia (1912-1979), who was known for her use of vibrant colors and large patterns. She first joined her husband's design firm, Printex, in 1949. In 1951, the company was renamed Marimekko, which means ""a little dress for Mary"" in Finnish. During the 1960s and '70s, the firm manufactured cotton, jersey, and wool fabrications, along with paper, laminated plastics, and table coverings. Ratia was known for designing free, easy fashions in bold painterly designs taking much of her inspiration from nature and handicraft. Ben Thompson, the founder of the retail establishment Design Research, Inc. (D/R), discovered Ratia's designs at the Finnish Pavilion of the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1957, and persuaded her to come to the United States. D/R became the exclusive representative of Marimekko products in women and children, as well as household accessories and furniture.",18,1951 – 1979,,18048723,,,,,"Marimekko, Inc.",,0,0,4723,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048723/,,,,,

"Charles Rennie Mackintosh is widely recognised as one of those crucial figures in the history of art and architecture who make the discoveries that alert others to the way forward.  He has been enrolled as a pioneer of modern design, herald of the International Style, prophet of Post-Modernism.  He also designed the Glasgow School of Art, as well as interior designs for many interiors.

Although Mackintosh was a very accomplished architect, he was also an important designer and watercolorist. Mackintosh's furniture was designed for specific rooms and settings. He insisted that form should follow function, and the function of his furniture was to make a visual statement. 

Mackintosh was born in 1868 in Glasgow, a city with which he was closely associated for the rest of his life. He studied to be an architect in Glasgow, and attended evening classes on art and design at the Glasgow School of Art. The majority of Mackintosh’s work was commissioned between 1896 and 1910. In addition to the Glasgow School of Art, he also designed the interiors of Miss Kate Cranston’s tearooms, the private houses of William Davidson and Walter Blackie. He was very popular in Germany and Austria, where he became friends with the designer Josef Hoffmann. He was commissioned to design the Warndorfer Music Salon, and he exhibited his work at the Turin International Exhibition of 1902. In contrast, he struggled to find success in Scotland. As he insisted on designing a house in its entirety, few clients were willing to hire Mackintosh. In 1914, he moved to the coast with his wife and painted watercolors. The following year, the couple moved to London, where he resumed work as an architect and designer. In 1923, the Mackintoshes moved once again, this time to the South of France, where Mackintosh only painted landscapes. He died of cancer on 10 December, 1928.",5,"Scottish, 1868–1928",/m/0f7tt,18044987,,,,3671,Charles Rennie Mackintosh,,0,0,2361,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044987/,65382,74645185,,54595,23424975

"Thomas Lamb was an industrial designer who gained the most notoriety for his design of physiologically efficient handles. From an early age he was interested in anatomy and physiology, and wanted to become a doctor. However, financial difficulties forced him to drop out of high school and he began work in a textile design shop. During this time he studied at the Art Students League, and finally at seventeen, Lamb opened his own textile design studio. His designs for home goods became very popular during the 1920s and were sold in major New York City department stores. He also created illustrations for books and magazines such as “Good Housekeeping"" magazine, which spurred even more designs. After World War II, Lamb turned his attention to the war effort. While at first he was designing items like “Victory napkins,” he soon turned his attention to the needs of veterans. This shift eventually led to the more ergonomic and functional work with handles. This is the work that gained him the most notoriety, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948. During his long career Lamb worked with a great deal of retailers, manufactures and stores, and created a large breadth of designs for a wide range of media and products.

"The Deerfield Society of Blue and White Neddlework was founded in Deerfield, Massachusets in 1896 and closed in 1926.  The founders were Margaret Whiting (1869 - 1946) and Ellen Miller (1854 - 1929).  All work was made in the town.
The original intention of the society was to reproduce the look of eighteenth century colonial embroideries using only blue and white yarns.  Early on the Deerfield work was exhibitied frequently at Arts and Crafts exhibitions.  Numerous referenes to the work of the society appeared in the contemporary press (House Beautiful, American Homes and Gardens, Mordern Priscilla, Handicrafts, etc.) and Deerfield was always described as the foremost of the village industries which appeared at that time.
Within a few years the Society of Blue and White Needlework was using yarns and fabrics in a wide range of colors for their work.  Members of the society did their own dyeing.  The range of patterns expanded to include contemporary designs.  However, the name remained the same and was in use until the society disbanded in 1926.",18,,,18051617,,,,,"Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework (American, 1896–1926)",,0,0,6472,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051617/,,,,,23424977

"Hella Jongerius was born in de Meern, Netherlands in 1963, and graduated from the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven in 1993. In Jongerius’ designs, she often manipulates ancient craft technique and modern technology to yield a product that reflects their ultimate potential. Her early work for Droog Design, the Dutch design collaborative, has been standout in the world of product design for over a decade. At her design firm, Jongeriuslab, materials largely determine the direction of their designs. The range of materials and techniques used at the firm are diverse and very broadly derived. For example, an exploration of polyurethane resulted in Soft Vases (1994), where the form of an antique urn is recast in soft, malleable polyurethane, and, in another project, a primitive wooden African prie-dieu, or prayer desk, is transformed into the Kasese Chair (1999), which couples the elemental nature of felt with futuristic carbon fiber while still preserving the poetry of the original form. Jongerius’ unique approach to design objects, specifically textiles, and her willingness to experiment leads to inspired final products.",12,"Dutch, b. 1963",,18055675,5661,,,7584,Hella Jongerius,,0,0,10403,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055675/,4296,79456651,,,23424909

"Russel Wright, who was born in Lebanon, Ohio on April 3, 1904 and died in 1976, was one of the most important pioneers in American design, especially in his efforts to revolutionize how people live and relate to their domestic environment. As Donald Albrecht wrote in his 2001 exhibition Russel Wright  Creating American Lifestyle, Wright’s “inexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative but were also the tools to achieve his concept of ‘easier living’, a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal.” The Cooper-Hewitt has over one hundred works in the collection by Wright, from a design drawing for flatware to extensive examples from his American Modern line of tableware and serving accessories.",83,"American, 1904–1976",/m/0cf_5k,18043357,601110,,,6460,Russel Wright,,0,0,1346,500001139,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043357/,1241,120170791,,4661570,23424977

"Ruth Reeves was a textile designer who was an associate and friend to many designers such as Donal Deskey and Henry Varnum Poor.  She participated in the first American Designer's Gallery exhibtion in 1929.  In 1932 she collaborated on the decoration of Radio City Music Hall and produced carpet designs for the project (an example of her carpet for the Grand Foyer of Radio City Music Hall is in the CHNDM collection 1987-69-1).
In 1934 Ruth Reeves studied the native textile and costume production in Guatemala and upon her return to New York produced an exhibtion held in the R.C.A. Building in 1935.  Costumes and fabrics brought back from Guatemala and Reeves adaptions of the designs were features of this exhibition.  CHNDM has two curtains designed by Reeves and made by Grete Franke.   At the same time Reeves produced a popularly priced line of Guatemalan textiles that were sold and promoted by R.H. Macy in New York.

"Born in Czechoslovakia, Mucha received his first formal training at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich from 1885-1887.  His patron Count Karl Khuen-Belassi, then sent him to Paris where he worked as a magazine and book illustrator.   Mucha established his reputation as an innovative designer with a series of nine lithograph posters commissioned by the actress Sarah Bernhardt along with two posters for Job cigarettes (1896 and 1898).  In these works Mucha created a unique style depicting exotic, sensuous women with long tangled hair together with densely-packed Byzantine and Moravian folk art motifs and stylized plants and flowers.   Mucha produced a number of designs for printed fabrics between 1897 and 1898.  All the designs were handled by the Paris firm of C.G. Forrer.  In addition to posters and textile designs Mucha executed designs for wallpaper, furniture, metalwork, flatware, glassware, lace and ornament all published in Documents Decorative par A.M. Mucha, Paris:  Librarie Central des Beaux-Arts, 1901.  Mucha was actively involved with the Paris 1900 Exposition Universelle, designing jewelry and a shop for Georges Fouquet.  In 1910 he returned to Bohemia where he executed a series of twenty paintings for the city of Prague in 1928.",11,"b. 1860 Ivancice, Moravia  –  d. 1939 Prague, Czechoslovakia",/m/0p_nx,18043027,629489,,,4136,Alphonse Maria Mucha,,0,0,1162,500030136,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043027/,9741,54279412,,102989,

"Alexander Girard (1907-93) was one of the leading American designers during the mid-twentieth century and was a strong proponent, along with his colleagues Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames, Kevin Roche and George Nelson, for bringing an affordable modernism to the middle class. The designs that resulted from these collaborations now define 1950s and 60s modernism in America. Educated as an architect at the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal School of Architecture in Rome, he came to the United States in 1932 to set up an architecture and interior design office in New York. Girard was the head of the Textile Division of Herman Miller Inc. from 1952 to 1973. During this time, Girard created over three hundred designs for textiles coordinated for use as upholstery fabrics, draperies and casement goods for private and commercial interiors, exhibitions and corporate identity programs. His exuberant use of color, texture and pattern drew from folk art and Op art influences, synthesized into a unique style which became “the look” of 1960s America. Ultimately settling in Santa Fe, New Mexico he continued to practice as a “designer” in the all-inclusive sense of the word, by designing residences, exhibitions, company identities, furniture and textiles throughout the duration of his career.",1395,"American, 1907–1993",,18046041,692846,,,,Alexander Hayden Girard,,0,0,2933,500096402,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046041/,,27870229,,7474087,23424977

"Frances Butler began as a printer of fabrics, printing calligraphy on fabric in 1965. In the beginning, she was interested in blending several art media, such as stretching a sewn fabric over metal structure and then painting it. Butler designed in several different media: posters, silkscreening and applique dressmaking. She was extremely experimental. When Butler tired of applique dressmaking, she began printing and airbrushing fabric for her dresses. Eventually she turned to the market and created functional products with her printed fabrics, such as comforters and tablecloths with printed words and images, and printed collapsible tea tables. In 1973, she launched a fabric printing company called Goodstuffs, which produced fabric graphics, wall hangings, and other products which were sold to J.C. Penney’s and Macy’s. Butler launched a publishing press called Poltroon Press for which she produced book illustrations and wall designs. With both companies, located in Emeryville, CA, she was able to produce different merchandise for interiors and households.",10,1940,,18046019,,,,,Frances Butler,,0,0,2922,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046019/,,,,,

"Husband-and-wife design team Charles and Ray Eames were formative and among the most influential figures in American design of the mid-twentieth century. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Charles Eames (1907–78) trained as an architect and worked early in his career for engineers, which evolved into a lifelong interest in mechanics and the complexities of how things worked. Bernice Alexandra (Ray) Kaiser Eames, (1912–88) born in Sacramento, California, had an interest in the abstract, and in the 1930s studied painting under Hans Hofmann in New York. Their interests and visions would blend seamlessly into the creation of influential, lasting designs. Together, the Eameses embraced the  concept of modern design as an agent of social change, creating designs for the overlapping needs of client, society, and designer and developing products that would serve all three. 

Ray and Charles Eames met in September 1940, after Ray entered the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Charles was already studying, and would soon become head of the industrial design department. He was working with fellow designer Eero Saarinen on an entry for the Museum of Modern Art's ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings"" exhibition/competition; Ray assisted in preparing drawings, and the result was a first-place-winning molded plywood chair. 

Charles and Ray were married in 1941 and moved to California. By 1943 they opened an office in a renovated garage, from where they worked together until Charles's death in 1978, and where Ray alone continued the practice until her death in 1988. They pioneered technologies, and adapted what had been considered ""industrial"" materials to office and domestic environments. Most notably, they developed a method for bending plywood in multiple directions, a continuation of the efforts begun at Cranbrook. During WWII, the Eameses worked for the US Navy--which granted them access to new synthetic glues--and applied their molded-plywood experiments to develop splints for injured troops, replacing the unhygienic, stiff metal ones previously used. After the war, they used this knowledge and experience to create their now-famous molded-plywood chairs and tables. Originally intended for Evans Products, the furniture was produced and marketed by Herman Miller beginning in 1946. That same year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York granted its first one-man show to Charles Eames, discrediting Ray's contributions to their work, a slight that would have lasting historical consequences. Their work was also presented in MoMA's ""Good Design"" shows of the 1950s. Their plywood and modular furniture, which sold well in its heydey, remain icons of midcentury American modern design today, and is still produced by Herman Miller today.",6,"American, 1912 – 1988",,18050087,628931,,,1672,Ray Eames,,0,0,5632,500029567,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050087/,12366,15576677,,,23424977

"University City Pottery was a division of the Art Institute at University City in Missouri.  It was promoted by Edward Garner Lewis who began the American Woman's League in 1907, whose purpose was to develop ""the integrity and purity of the American home, with wider opportunity for American women.""  The Art Institute was more developed than the other schools of education, language, commerce, administration, journalism and photography.  The Art Insitute had a prestigious faculty:  George Julian Zolnay, the sculptor, was Dean and Director; John H. Vanderpoel, Director of the School of Painting; Antoinette P. Taylor, instructor of metal and leather work; Mrs. Prudence Stokes Brown, instructor of elementary handiwork; Taxile Doat, Director of the School of Ceramic Art.  
Working with Taxile Doat in ceramics: Frederick Hurten Rhead of Rhead Pottery, instructor of pottery; Mrs. Adelaide Alsop Robineau of Robineau Pottery; Mrs. Kathryn E. Cherry, Instructor of China Painting and Ceramic Design; Edward Dahlquist of Shawsheen Pottery, instructor of built pottery; Frank J. Fuhrmann, instructor of throwing and turning pottery; Eugene Labarriere and Emile Diffloth both associates of Doat's from Europe.   
The experiments of this knowledgeable group proved that native United States clays were superior to the finest of Europe and were more widely available.  The Grand Prize awarded to the University City Pottery in Turin, Italy, at the International Exposition in 1911 further emphasized that this American pottery could compete with the best of Europe.  The pottery was noted for its superior bodies, matt and gloss glazes, colored and colorless, all of the matt greens of various textures, alligator skin, crystalline, Oriental crackle, and a matt white.  These were accomplished by glazes with the coloring oxides thoroughly incorporated and then fired at the same temperature as the body. 
Frederick Hurten Rhead and Mr. and Mrs. Robineau left the pottery in 1911, as well as the break up of the American Women's League occurred at this time.  After a reorganization under Doat, in 1912, the pottery continued to produce excellent work with the ending of production by early 1915.

"Founded in 1880 by Maria Longworth Nichols, Rookwood produced appealing vases, hand-decorated by a diverse group of talented artists. There were 20-25 artists decorating pieces at any given time. Many were innovative as well as talented. In the early 1900s, Rookwood began using matte finishes and vellum glaze, a translucent matte glaze. Rookwood filed for bankruptcy in 1941 and, although it did reorganize, it was repeatedly sold and finally shut down in the 1960s. In 1886, Rookwood began using the insignia--a backwards R with a P, and subsequently added a flame around the letters, adding a flame each year to indicate the date the piece was produced. Stating in 1900, the year of production is indicated in Roman numerals; besides the factory insignia and the date, there is a decorator's insignia, and often a clay or body mark and a size mark (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",42,founded 1880,/m/02x8kvf,18043903,,,,,Rookwood Pottery,,0,0,1719,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043903/,3482,,,30862869,23424977

"Upon graduating in 1984 from Pasadena’s Art Center College of Design, Méndez taught first at her alma mater and then in the Design Media Arts Department at UCLA where she is presently working.  In 1996 she also opened Rebeca Méndez Studio in partnership with her husband Adam Eeuwens.  She specializes in film and video installations for cultural programs and institutions, collaborations with architects on interior commissions, photography, book design, and public art commissions.  All of her creative activity embodies an important set of values, experimentation, collaboration, and creative integrity.  The natural world is a thread running through all of Méndez’s work.   She has traveled to such “extreme” environments as the Sahara desert, Patagonia, Iceland, Chili, and Finland, and the Arctic, studying how different cultures relate to and portray nature and documenting her research through photography.   Méndez was the recipient of the 2012 National Design Award in the field of graphic design.",10,b. 1962,/m/02qgvcp,18049203,,,,,Rebeca Méndez,,0,0,5062,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049203/,,,,10528970,

"Dumas was inspired by folk cloth, particularly blue and white resist-dyed textiles of China and Europe. She used the folk language in her own works but without using the method of resist dyeing and indigo; rather, she preferred using new techniques and dyes. Dumas moved to Berkely, CA in 1933 and taught at the University for 20 years.  She was devoted to teaching and her relationship with the University was one of mutual appreciation.",32,"American, 1912–1971",,18058263,,,,,Mary Dumas,,0,0,11907,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18058263/,,,,,23424977

"Armitage studied painting at the Chelsea School of Art. She looks to nature for themes, taking her first design “Angelica” from plants that grew along a riverbank in Chiswick as inspiration. Armitage grew up in Kew and loved to go to the Royal Botanic Gardens which she liked to recreate in her elegant wallpapers. She was a Master of the Art Workers’ Guild member. In the 1950s and 60s, when amorphic and abstract designs were popular, Armitage focused on an architectural and bold graphic style. 
After a two-year stay in India, she began linocut printing, producing papers by hand; but soon after, she resigned herself to purchasing a manual offset lithographic printing press. This allowed Armitage to do large scale printing.",2,,,18058211,,,,,Marthe Armitage,,0,0,11817,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18058211/,,,,,

"Edward Bawden was a watercolorist, book illustrator, mural painter and designer. In 1925, Bawden saw William Morris's wallpaper ""Daisy"" in an exhibition and was inspired to design his first wallpaper. Harold Curwen saw some of these early designs and wanted to transfer the pieces to his lithographic press so they could be reproduced  and sold. Bawden designed 14 wallpapers between 1926 and 1933 for the Curwen Press. After 1933, Edward Bawden continued to design wallpaper for the English firm, Cole & Sons until the 1950's.",16,"English, 1903 – 1989",/m/05_dv5,18046723,,,,395,Edward Bawden,,0,0,3321,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046723/,31266,64278933,,1830848,23424975

Inge Dusi is a textile artist of German origin, who, except for three years of study in Munich, Germany, lived in Chile until 1974. At that point, she moved to Costa Rica where she lived for another 6 years. Between 1983 and 1997 she resided in Milan, Italy.

Her inspiration comes from her exposure to “amarra”, a technique originally used in Pre-Colombian textiles and internationally recognized nowadys as Shibori. An invitation form th Museum of Contemporary Crafts of New York and a Fullbright Foundation scholarship allowed her to meet important textile artists in th USA. While in Milan, she became part of a group of fiber artists who devoted themselves to applying their art to fashion.  This contact with the italian textile industry and its larg variety of fibers and fabrics has enriched her work and, consequently, it led her to be twice selected as the italian representative to the International Textile Design Contest held by the Fashion Foundation of Tokio, Japan. 

In 1997 she returned to Chile, and along with japanese artist Yoshiko I. Wada, she organized the third International Shibori Symposium at both, the Museum of fine Arts and the Museum of Pre-Colombian Art in Santiago.

The works of Inge Dusi can be found in collections at the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts (Smithsonian Institution), and the Jack Lenor Larsen Collection, both in New York; the Amaral Textile Museum in Bogotá, Colombia; and in private collections throughout the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and Chile. She has held and participed in exhibitions throughout Latin America, Europe, Japan and the United States.",1,,,51676343,,,,,Inge Dusi (German),,0,0,11924,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676343/,,,,,

"Non-Format is a two-person creative direction and communication design firm founded by Kjell Ekhorn (Norwegian, b. 1965) and Jon Forss (British, b.1966).  After meeting in England in the late 1990s, Ekhorn and Forss collaborated on several projects before establishing their own firm EkhornForss Limited in 2001.  The name was soon changed to Non-Format, which the two derived from an article in the popular design magazine Emigre about the future demise of the DVD and the impending “mythical non-format” that would replace it.  While the duo founded the company when they were both living in London, they have since moved an ocean apart and several time zones apart.  Forss has been based in St. Paul, Minnesota since 2007 and Ekhorn has worked from Norway since 2009.  A true twenty-first century design team, the partners spend much of their time collaborating with the aid of the internet, swapping ideas and files and holding meetings via Skype.  Their work has included art direction, design, illustration, and custom typography for commercial clients including Adobe, Coca-Cola, EMI, Gap, IBM, New York Times, Nike, Nokia, Rock Owens, and Sony Music.  Non-Format’s earliest projects were music packaging, and they continue to produce innovative and creative designs in this field, most notably with Lo Recordings, with whom they have worked since Non-Format was founded.  Non-Format has received a number of design awards, including a D&AD Yellow Pencil, two Tokyo TDC Prizes, and a New York ADC Gold.",2,,,51676363,,,,,Non-Format,,0,0,16841,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676363/,,,,,

It succeeded mainly because of the design and quality of the pottery
 Ceramics engineer William Rea, who created the dish model, continued with a line of ceramics including an olive green mix that produced  gradations of color in the finished product, unlike existing pottery. As the soap dish giveaway slowed, in 1903 the Buffalo Pottery Company became the sole distributor of this pottery dubbed Deldare Ware. The Buffalo Pottery Company expanded to include other china related products.  Buffalo launched a commercial business in 1914 by making some of the first vitrified china on the market, created specifically for hotel dining rooms and restaurants.
 The Buffalo Pottery Company is still in business today and it is operating as a division of Oneida, Ltd.",1,Founded 1902,,51685783,,,,,Buffalo Pottery,,0,0,18569,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685783/,,,,,23424977

"Murrle Bennett & Co was established in London by Ernst Murrle and J.B Bennett and specialized in high quality affordable silver and gold jewelry. The firm produced jewelry predominantly  in the Art Nouveau style. Their designs were often characterized by abstract motifs typical of Art Nouveau and the Arts & Crafts movements. Often comprised of Celtic inspired interlacing elements, stylized foliate forms, pierced geometric shapes, luminous enamels and precious or semi-precious stones. After World War I, the company was renamed White Redgrove & White. Murrle Bennett & Co jewelry is now highly sought-after and widely collected.",1,,,51685781,,,,,Murrle Bennett & Co.,,0,0,18568,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685781/,,,,,

"Both a manufacturer and brand, Plus Minus Zero was co-founded by industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa in Japan in 2003, with the idea to design products that do not raise people’s expectations about function directly through design, but improve the quality of the users lives in a more general way. The brand name seems to refer to the concept of creating design that is just right, that is complete only when nothing can be added or subtracted to improve it. The brand focuses on small household appliances and electronics, but has also produced tableware and items like the Sole Bag, a simple white tote made to rest firmly on the ground, its bottom designed as the treaded sole of a shoe. Ignoring sylistic trends, Plus Minus Zero designs are characterized by minimalism and attention to detail, and can display the designer's subtle sense of humor as well.

"Maria Likarz-Strauss was a very influential designer during her tenure at the Wiener Werkstatte. Extremely prolific, the designer produced nearly 200 designs for the workshop. She is best known for her abstract and geometric patterns. She attended the Applied Arts School between 1911 and 1915. In 1912 she was hired by the Wiener Werkestatte and worked there as a manager until 1932. It is said that her works anticipated the art deco style of the 1920s and 30s.",1,"Austrian, 1893–1971",,51685419,,,,,Maria Likarz-Strauss,,0,0,18481,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685419/,,,,,23424750
"Catherine Cranston, born in Glasgow in 1849, was a leading figure in the development of tea rooms throughout Glasgow. She founded the Willow Tea Rooms (1894-1904) on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and was a major patron of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh’s novel aesthetic interiors, including unusual furniture, elaborately stenciled walls and ornate fittings, brought a new era of progressive design to the attention of the Glasgow public and encouraged repeat customers for Miss Cranston in the competitive world of Glasgow tearooms. Cranston died in 1934 and is remembered for both her patronage of modern design as well as the crucial role her tea rooms played in turn-of-the-century Glasgow society.",3,"Scottish, 1849 - 1934",,51685437,,,,,Miss Catherine Cranston,,0,0,18499,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685437/,,,,,23424975

"The London-based design studio Wallace Sewell was established by Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell after graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1990. Both women trained as weavers, and all of their products are designed by hand on the loom. The specifications are sent to the mill, and the fabrics are  woven on power looms, with careful attention given to maintaining the qualities of a hand-weave. Most of their yarns are sourced from British companies, and are woven in Lancashire. The studio also works with a finisher in Yorkshire.
In addition to their line of fashion and home accessories, Wallace Sewell has created fabrics for the London Underground and Overground trains, Croydon trams and the East London Transit.",1,established 1992,,51676709,,,,,Wallace Sewell,,0,0,17090,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676709/,,,,,

"Bloom, San Francisco (2011-2012) was a creative design studio whose goal was to promote new types of visual discovery experiences – or “visual instruments” – to help users explore and navigate and understand their lives as experienced through online and social services. Bloom was founded in 2011 by three principals: Ben Cerveny, Tom Carden and Jesper Anderson. Robert Hodgin joined later that year as Creative Director.",1,"American, 2011 - 2012",,51677191,,,,,Bloom Studio,,0,0,17342,,http://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51677191/,,,,,

"London-based Isokon (an acronym for Isometric Unit Construction), was established in 1931 by Jack and Rosemary (Molly) Pritchard and other partners, to design and construct modular houses, apartment buildings, and later, modernist plywood furniture. Another principal in the firm was architect and designer Wells Coates; the company was originally founded in 1929, and called Wells Coates and Partners.  Isokon’s seminal architectural project was the 1934 modernist Lawn Road Flats in Hempstead, sometimes referred to as the Isokon building. In late 1935, the Isokon Furniture Company was established to manufacture and distribute plywood furniture by several designers. Jack Pritchard was initially involved in the firm’s finances, marketing and publicity, but eventually went on to direct the company and hire designers.

""As Pritchard later explained: 'The business was set up in order to exploit the growing demand for modern furniture. Our object was first to establish a good-will for authentic modern furniture at the high price market, and secondly to develop from that position to the mass market.'
Following the original definition of Isokon, he set forth in more formal terms the policies of the new furniture company: 
'The general principal governing the policy will be in the designing, making and distributing of furniture, fittings, and equipment which will help to make contemporary living pleasanter, comfortable, and more efficient. Uniformity in character and design, combined with variety and individuality of each item should be achieved.'""1

After an exhibition of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto’s plywood furniture in London in 1933, Pritchard recognized a large potential market for such furniture in England, and wanted Isokon to manufacture and distribute its own line of modern bent plywood furniture. Pritchard was instrumental in engaging former Bauhaus director and architect Walter Gropius, who had moved to England from Germany in 1935. By 1936, Pritchard had hired  Bauhaus innovator Marcel Breuer, Gropius' friend and also a recent émigré, to design Isokon’s first plywood chairs. The company ceased production in 1939, at the onset of World War II, when its supply of plywood was cut off.
