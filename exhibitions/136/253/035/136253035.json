    "text": "Mirrors have been an important element in my work for the past year. Officeman, 2015, which I created for New York Fashion Week Men\u2019s in July, incorporated a room\u2014a cube\u2014of mirrors that produced an infinity effect. Given the opportunity to select from Cooper Hewitt\u2019s collection my thoughts again turned to reflective surfaces and contouring shapes\u2014some more than 300 years old. I was drawn to their unparalleled craftsmanship in the same way that I appreciate the quality of superbly tailored clothing---fine detail, exceptional material, and unique character. These objects are sometimes expressive of a particular time-period, but all are uniformly timeless in their function. Mirrors are frames for self-examination. Frames establish borders and hone focus. In this installation I invite visitors to explore their reflections, to see the confident side of themselves, and to ultimately appreciate their individuality.",
