The front of the sarcophagus is supported by balusters the upper part of which are in front of the sarcophagus.  Above the balusters a lion mask with handles.  In the middle is an oval of palm branches with a cross.  The alternative suggestions refer only to different coloring.  The letter \"M\" is written in the low head piece, \"G\" in the entablature of the mensa.  Three steps.  The altar stands in front of the central part of the base of a kind of retable, executed in marble and gilded parts. The retable is marked several times \"O,\" as it is twice in the space of the wall, besides one \"N.\"  Only the lower part of the retable is shown, having a central part of marble and two columns on either side.  Framed above written in pencil: \"Mario Asprucci\/ Urna per la capella Borghesiana\/ a S.M. Maggiore.\"",
