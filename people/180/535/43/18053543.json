    "biography": "After graduating from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1949, the American graphic designer Jacqueline Casey worked extensively in various creative industries such as fashion illustration, advertising, interior decorating and publication design. In 1955, she joined the publication office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). When Muriel Cooper, the then head of the office, left in 1972, Casey took over Cooper\u2019s position and produced a large number of graphic works until her retirement in 1989. Throughout her appointment at the office, she developed MIT\u2019s visual language with the active employment of the Swiss design style, influenced by the work of renowned Swiss designers such as Karl Gerstner, Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann. A grid system and sans-serif typefaces became important visual elements that constituted the image of MIT. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Moll, a young Swiss graphic designer who briefly worked at the MIT publication office, is credited with introducing Casey to concepts of European typography.",
