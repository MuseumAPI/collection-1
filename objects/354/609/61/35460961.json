    "description":"\"Nile\" green, exaggerated, almost anthropomorphic baluster form, with bell-shaped base rising with undulating profile to everted top, the tapered conical stopper resting with half in the long neck for support.",
    "justification":"Color and original design are two key components of&amp;nbsp; Blenko glass. The firm had five really important designers, of which Wayne Husted was the second. It is he who introduced to Blenko the concepts of Studio Glass before it became a movement. His abstracted forms and rich use and experimentation with the color palette make him a key person in the history of the firm.&amp;nbsp; This piece is datable precisely because it was only sold for one year, 1957, in this color, called Nile green. It embodies the more flamboyant elements of late 1950's design but applied to a glass object that, for him has a secondary agenda as a functional object, a decanter with stopper.&amp;nbsp; These decanters were marketed as functional objects in the catalogue and many were purchased with use in mind. However, for Husted, it is clear that he was primarily interested in it as sculptural, richly colored form for display, thus bringing into Blenko's portfolio a mix of art and design in the same object.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \nThe fact that the Blenko mark is sandblasted, a labor-intensive process, rather than acid etched, is another indication of the handwork that continued to set Blenko apart from modern-designed mass market glass being produced in the United States at the same time.",
