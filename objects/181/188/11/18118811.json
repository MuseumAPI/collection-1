    "description": "Horizontal composition of an organ and organ loft. The loft is supported by four consoles with small angels in the panels above them. The lateral parts of the parapet are concave while the central part is convex. It is decorated with an escutcheon with the representation fo David playing the harp. Two angels are on parapet stands on the left while three vases with flowers are on the right. The upper part of the central motif of the cresting of the organ case is missing. Legs standing between leaf scrolls are visible and the loft is shown somewhat from below. The uppermost part of the doorframe is also shown.",
