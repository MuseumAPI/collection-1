    "description":"Repeating design of a pair of red cherries, connected by a stem. Printed in shades of red on a green foil ground.  The red pigments contain microencapsulated oils scented with a cherry fragrance. Scratch and sniff version, can also be purchased without the scent.",
    "justification":"Cherry Forever is one of three scented wallpapers in this company's line and is the first commercially produced scratch and sniff wallpaper.&amp;nbsp; Available in three flavors: cherry, banana and tutti fruity this paper is produced using technology first developed by 3M in 1965.&amp;nbsp; Fragrance oils are microencapsulated and printed on the wallpaper surface.&amp;nbsp; The fragrance is released by scratching which breaks the microencapsulated cells.&amp;nbsp; It is possible for the scent to last up to 20 years, but &amp;nbsp;scratching disturbs\/abrades the printed surface.&amp;nbsp; Even without the smell it is an attractive paper and the first of its kind.\nNovelty papers go back at least as far as the mid-19th century.&amp;nbsp; They were frequently commemorative, humorous, or educational and frequently contained landscape vistas and trompe l'oeil elements.&amp;nbsp; Due to the influence of the British Reform Movement and their belief that all walls must present a 2-dimensional surface these papers were deemed less than appropriate for proper homes.&amp;nbsp; Kitchen, bathroom and children's papers are frequently grouped into this category.&amp;nbsp; Novelty papers reached their peak in the 1950s in the post-war boom and then kind of fizzled out until the last 15 years or so.&amp;nbsp; Novelty papers were usually hung in the less formal rooms of the home.&amp;nbsp; They could be amusing, cocktail\/gambling related, personifications of French poodles, or educational in nature.&amp;nbsp; The recent emergence of many small studios printing on a small-scale allows designers\/artists to market their wares to niche markets opening a new window for novelty papers.&amp;nbsp; Many of the novelty papers produced today are political or satirical in nature.",
