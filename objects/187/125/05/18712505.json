    "description":"This 'bas relief' textile is created in a macro-scale version of an embroidery technique employed in the so-called Bayeux Tapestry (11th century, Normandy, France). The stitch is referred to as 'point de couchage' or 'point lanc\u00e9 et couch\u00e9'.\nThe natural linen woven base cloth is stretched in tension on a wooden frame. Skeins or coils of bleached linen are alternately twisted in the 's' or 'z' directions, and anchored to the foundation by sewing them with strong linen thread using a semi-circular needle, allowing the artist to control and stabilize the volume.",
    "justification":"Cour de Rohan (1997), which is a larger scale piece and bears the same name of her home in Paris, is an example of Hick\u2019s \u201cmacro-embroidery\u201d process, which is a an scale-up version of the embroidery stitch, also known as point de couchage' or 'point lanc\u00e9 et couch\u00e9', employed in the Bayeux Tapestry of Normandy beginning in the 11th century. Hicks has stretched and assembled multiple linen yarns in varying lengths and has hand-sewn them after alternately twisting in 's' or 'z' directions. The only tool she employed was a half moon, rounded needle. The natural linen woven base cloth was stretched in tension and the skeins or coils of bleached linen were anchored on to it by sewing them with strong linen thread, holding and stabilizing the volume, and creating a bas-relief.&amp;nbsp; ",
