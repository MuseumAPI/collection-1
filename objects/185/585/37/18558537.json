    "description":"The gray panel is decorated with vertical rows of rising waves, which are connected horizontally by petals. The waves consist of leaf boughs, and the petals are small sized, at left, of an indistinct material but great petals, at right. Rosettes between boughs, of different designs at left and at right, decorate the oblique low-pointed ovoids. A stem with alternate pairs of red and of vine leaves lies across the top; its upper part is shown against the gray background.",
