  "description": "Photographed on a woven fabric background, arranged so as to form curves, a woman's hand, clothed in an opaque white fabric glove, extends diagonally across the page from the upper right to the lower left. Three fingers cradle the bottom half of an open compact, while the thumb just touches the far side of the lid. The compact is framed in metal, and a foliate motif, which appears to have been fabricated of metal, perhaps silver, adorns the lower half of the black lid, perhaps onyx. The powder compartment inside the lower part of the bottom half is glimpsed beneath the open lid.  Deep shadows in the fabric appear under the fingers and alongside the edges of the glove above the wrist, where the glove abuts the edge of the page.",
