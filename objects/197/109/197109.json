  "description": "On paper parchment, an ornamental border composed of traditional motifs from antiquity (e.g., Greek key, rosettes) outlines the entire design. Certificate of Award is imprinted in a curved form in a simulated three-dimensional lettering style across the top, and cloud-like gray shadows overlaid by flower sprigs form the background. Within an ornate frame, an illustration of a banana peel in yellow, outlined and highlighted in black, is centered between the first and third titular words. This certifies that is imprinted in block letters in the lower part of this frame beneath the illustration. Eight lines of script describing the award are imprinted across the lower half of the page. Directly below on the left, Tibor Kalman's signature, in child-like upper and lower case lettering, appears above a thin line, below which he is identified as Chairman; on the right, the signature, Bruce Blackburn, appears above another line, below which he is identified as President, AIGA.",
