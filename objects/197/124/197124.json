  "description": "Near the top edge, centered, is the Memphis (condominiums) logo in red. Above it  is the word uptown and below is the three-line address, both in black. The logo is repeated just above the lower edge, centered. The word downtown is underneath the logo, followed by the three-line address, both in black. In the upper right-hand corner and lower left-hand corner, are excerpted grids, in pink, of the streets in which the condominiums are located, superimposed on blue-green representing, in each case, the waters of the neighboring river. The logo's letter M, with the red ball at the bottom of the left-hand vertical, is imprinted on the grids.",
