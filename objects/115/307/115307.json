  "description": "The head is tilted upward in this lightly sketched profile. The filled in nostril emphasizes the upward tilt of the nose. Shading emphasizes the cheekbone and the continuing line from the chin upward to the right and the vertical line of the neck, which stops short of a beaded choker. Curly tendrils of hair frame the face above ear-level.",
