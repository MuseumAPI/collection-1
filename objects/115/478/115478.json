  "description": "Occupying the entire page, the present frontal view is of a female with an ovoid face, in which empty eye sockets under straight brows; a straight nose; and full, closed, barely smiling lips comprise the features. Strands of long, wavy hair, intertwined with leaves, jut out sideways from the top of the forehead, ending at the shoulders, which are depicted by a single curved line on each side of the neck. There is a resemblance to antique renderings of the Gorgon Medusa's snake-filled hair.",
