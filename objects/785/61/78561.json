  "description": "Vertical sheet with four sketches of architectural elements.  At top left is a faucet in the shape of a winged bird.  At right is the section of a door from the church of St. Anastasia.  The door is composed of rows of small tri-lobed arches, possibly painted white, and decorated by nailheads.  Below this at right is another wood door from St. Anastasia also with a creamy-white finish.  This door is ornamented by rows of carved quatrefoils with a border of half-rosettes and a diamond pattern.  Dark gray nailheads stand out in contrast.  At lower left is a section of an iron railing consisting of joined quatrefoils.",
