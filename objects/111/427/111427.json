  "description": "Rectangular panel of cream colored cotton printed in red. The design shows various shadow figures made with the hands. In a large central oval frame, a pair of hands making the shadow of a rabbit, titled below \"Bunny.\" In the four corners are hands and shadows forming \"The Camel,\" \"The Dog,\" \"The Goose,\" and \"The Goat.\" To the left and right of the central oval, the crest of the Prince of Wales-- three plumes in a crown-- and the legend \"Ich Dien\" (\"I Serve\"). The configurations are similar to those found in Henry Bursill's \"Hand Shadows to Be Thrown Upon the Wall,\" 1859.",
