The tower has a stonework lancet on all sides and small bell visible in the center.  Its roof rises to a very narrow steeple and is adorned on all sides by very finely worked crockets.  The other belfry at right is also Gothic in style but much more simple, rising from a short octagonal tower and encircled by a gallery.  It has a paneled roof that rises to a narrow steeple with small ball finial at top.",
