The wall dead-ends at center of sheet on a chartreuse horizontal wall, behind which is a purple, silo-shaped building.  In the center of the plaza is a glass-domed vitrine holding a three-quarter length dressmaker's form, topped by a floral wreath; there is a measuring tape around the neck and an inscription \"Schaperel... \" [sic] around the hips.  To the right is a grassy area with a dead tree viewed against a deep blue sky.",
