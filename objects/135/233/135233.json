  "description": "A royal wagon with circular front and rear suspension is decorated with sphinxes, satyrs and double tailed winged supporters. The carriage is constructed with an open lattice work top allowing for visibility of the two male passengers inside. THe carraige is pulled along be two horses at right above which a front elevation of the suspension element is shown.\r\nA block of text is printed across the top of the sheet.\r\n\r\nThis version of the print has been cut out and mounted on a thick sheet of tan machine made wove paper. It is hand colored, definitely at a later date possibly 19th century, with opaque watercolor and also thin washes. The text block has been colored to simulate marble and the carriage has been treated with gold paint to suggest gilding. The elaborate strapwork border, or frame around the image has also been painted.",
