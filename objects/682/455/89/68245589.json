    "description": "a tri-lobate cruciform pendant with blue-green enamel divided by silver supports and centered by a mother-of-pearl boss, with baroque pearl pendant from the bottom, with thin-gauge silver wire chain",
    "justification": "Pendants formed a smaller but popular form of Horner jewelry.&amp;nbsp; Celtic crosses had inspired arts and crafts movement jewelry. In Horner\u2019s creations, they evolved into a more art nouveau style. The first pendant (.6) shows the more laborious basse-taille technique with chasing or engraving under the layers of blue and green mixed translucent enamel, all set within the raised fields of silver, centered by a cut of abalone mother-of-pearl circle, and with a pendant freshwater pearl below it.\nNo design authorship is claimed anywhere on drawings or in catalogues for any of the designs the firm produced. However, the most art nouveau pieces were produced \u201cin house\u201d after the creation of the purpose-built factory in 1905. The consistently high quality of the enameling suggests that the firm hired enamelists who were especially skilled to make the most art nouveau style pieces. This is especially apparent in the pieces dating from 1905-1913. \nWhile most of the jewelry was mass-produced, using silver wire, ribbon or formed into swirls, circles and other shapes, presumably on a fixed template, the enameling would have been done by hand and most was made in the basse-taille \u2013or shallow-cut- technique.&amp;nbsp; This technique involves cutting through engraving or chasing silver with bas-relief patterns and covering that in translucent enamel. Rich tonal qualities are achieved by varying the amounts of engraving and depth of enamel. \n&amp;nbsp;For both pendants and brooches in this collection, they would have been sold wholesale, primarily from catalogue or the factory in Halifax. &amp;nbsp;The era of the department store had begun. Along with the broadening range of retail by many smaller jewelry businesses across Britain and abroad, especially in the United States, they looked to Horner and others for fashion conscious well-made objects to sell.\n&amp;nbsp;",
