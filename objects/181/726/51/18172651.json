The building has rusticated walls and four Doric columns on the front facade.  There are three small entrances to the building.  The one in the center is at the base level while the two side entrances are elevated from the ground by a high foundation.  A large panel with an inscription is placed on the side of the terrace's balustrade.  Positioned against the main facade, at the center, is a sculptural grouping of \"Justice.\"  It is placed directly above the central doorway.  Crowds of people surround the structure, and isolated persons or couples are dispersed elsewhere.",
