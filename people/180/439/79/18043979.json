    "biography": "Beatrice Wood studied painting at the Acad\u00e9mie Julien and acting at the Com\u00e9die Francaise. She lived in New York and befriended many of the great artists of the 20th century, including Man Ray, Francis Picabia, and Charles Sheeler, among others. Dubbed \u201cthe Mama of Dada,\u201d she and Man Ray co-founded the magazine, Blind Man, which was one of the earliest manifestations of Dada art in New York. Beatrice did not encounter ceramics until the 1930s when she enrolled in a pottery course at Hollywood High School. It wasn\u2019t until 1940 when she studied with ceramicists Gertrud and Otto Naztler that she began appreciating ceramics in a new way. In 1948, she settled in Ojai, CA and created ceramic figurines, decorative vessels and dinner sets which supported her throughout her career.",
