    "biography": "Livio Castiglioni was born in Milan on January 16, 1911 into a family of industrial designers and architects. He first studied architecture in the Politecnico, Milan to 1936. In 1938, he set up a studio with his brother Pier Giacomo and architect Luigi Caccia Dominioni. The studio closed in 1940, but before disbanding, in that year the partners designed silver and aluminum flatware, and the Bakelite-housed Model 547 radio, manufactured by Phonola. The radio won a gold medal at the VII Triennale in Milan, and is now considered an important early example of Italian product design. Livio\u2019s ensuing work won several gold medals and a grand prize in later Triennales. From 1946 to 1964, he consulted for Phonola while collaborating with other audio-visual firms including Brionvega, Montecatini Edison and Fiat, as well as the Eurodomus fair, La Rinascente department store, and Olivetti. In the 1950s, Livio also worked on lightning designs, occasionally collaborating with his brothers Pier Giacomo and Achille. Livio\u2019s designs were distinguished by their \u201cuse of industrial materials and new bulbs.\u201d He participated in the founding of the ADI (Associazione per il Disegno Industriale), serving as its president from 1959-60. Livio is also credited with designing the audio-visual environment presentations in the Italian pavilion at the 1967 Montreal Universal and International Exhibition (Expo \u201967) just prior to his death.",
