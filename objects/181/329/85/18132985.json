    "description": "Mantle decorated with series of broad and narrow horizontal bands in reds, pale tan, cream, pale yellow, blues, silver.  A broad band across the middle is made up of ten narrow bands, with adjacent rectangles containing Inca geometric patterns and some adapted Tiahuanaco eye forms, separated throughout and edged top and bottom with variety of guard stripes.  Above and below this broad central band are slightly narrower pink bands, edged top and bottom with small stepped scallops and filled with close-set mermaids and bird, fish, animal and floral motives, seemingly scattered, but actually set symmetrically on either side of two central vases set one above the other in each band and filled with flowers and fruit. Two narrow bands with attendant varied guard stripes border the mantle at top and bottom; the inner red band is similar to the bands in the center of the mantle; the outer cream-grounded band contains a series of bird, fish, and floral motives symmetrically spaced on either side of the central axis of the mantle; pink guard stripes terminate the mantle at top and bottom.",
    "justification": "This beautiful cloth woven of silk and silver threads is a woman\u2019s shoulder mantle, called a&amp;nbsp; lliclla in the Quechua language of the Inca empire, made during the colonial period of Peru.&amp;nbsp; A perfect blend of the cross-cultural elements of the 16th -17th century era of global trade, the Chinese silk and Spanish silver threads are woven with Inca techniques and design to make the quintessential Andean garment.\nThe abstract designs of geometric squares, tocapu rendered in modulated colors form a cascade that moves from left to right. Each small square is its own universe\u2014some scholars believe that they represent a language.&amp;nbsp; This from a culture that had no written language.&amp;nbsp; Though we do not know today what exactly the tocapu represent, in Inca times, these designs were allowed to be used only by the Inca king and to those he extended the privilege, through gifts of specially woven garments embellished with them in specific ways. &amp;nbsp;A woman wearing such a garment was no doubt a member of one of the noble families, and even after the Spanish arrival to the New World, display of one\u2019s Inca heritage held sway in &amp;nbsp;colonial society. \nThe garment is woven in tapestry weave\u2014a type of cloth called cumbi which indicated its high status.&amp;nbsp; For the Inca, cumbi cloth was most valued, used for the garments of the king and produced by specialists.&amp;nbsp; Weaving hundreds of yarns per inch with the finest of materials the Inca weavers left an indelible tradition. During colonial times, former Inca-trained weavers continued to create high quality weavings for new purposes, and as we see here, inclusion of new materials and motifs impart new levels of meaning to their design and production.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (Note the mermaids in the two flora- and fauna-filled panels.)\nRectangular in shape, this traditional Andean garment was likely made as a wedding mantle.&amp;nbsp; Its fine silk would have come to Peru via the Manila Galleons\u2014trade ships that plied the ocean routes from Lima, Peru to the Philippines, that served as the major port for trade from China, beginning in the late 16th century. &amp;nbsp;Carrying a cargo of valuable American silver, the Spanish ships returned from Asia loaded with Chinese silks and porcelain.&amp;nbsp; The silver threads also likely came by sea voyage\u2014across the Atlantic from Spain to Peru, through a circuitous route.&amp;nbsp; Peruvian silver was sent to Spain, where it supported the enterprise of the Spanish empire, and where some was made into metal threads: these were exported back to Peru for use in the weaving and making of garments. The Peruvians formerly did not have the custom to produce silver threads, and eagerly adapted this European taste into their weavings, and along with the Chinese silk created objects of hybrid beauty, such as this mantle that retains&amp;nbsp; the traditions of the Inca past, while transforming the aesthetic of luxury in a new complex society.",
