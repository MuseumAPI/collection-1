    "biography": "David Watkins has been a working artist since the 1960s, and is considered a pioneer in the studio jewelry movement. He has been a professor of goldsmithing, silver and metalsmithing, and jewelry at the Royal College of Art since 1984, combining careers as a professor with that of a studio jeweler and sculptor. He trained as a sculptor at the University of Reading and worked as a jazz musician, artist and teacher before turning his attention to jewelry in 1971.\n\nEarly in his career he developed an interest in the formal nature of jewelry--defining the balance between line and space and the relationship between body and form. Watkins also developed an interest in technology and has become known for his experimental approach to materials and technology. Watkin\u2019s innovative and experimental approach--informed by past careers in sculpture, jazz, and model making--and promotion of jewelry as wearable art positioned him at the forefront of the discipline. Watkins challenged the demand that craft be functional, traditional and made of natural materials. His work is included in major museums throughout the world.",
