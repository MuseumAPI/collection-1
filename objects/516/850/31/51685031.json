    "justification": "\nMichael Eden, an important British studio &amp;nbsp;ceramicist for over twenty years&amp;nbsp; who worked&amp;nbsp;to create a variety of traditionally fired ceramic forms, predominantly in slip cast earthenware, has turned his attention to ceramic-inspired&amp;nbsp; rapid protoyped objects.&amp;nbsp; He was excited by the possibilities the process held for ceramic design outside of the confines of manufacture. At the Royal College of Art he saw the potential for CAD drawing to achieve works that could not be made by hand and that could&amp;nbsp;re-define the creative process, first with a piece called \u201cThe Wedgwoodn\u2019t Tureen.\u201d&amp;nbsp; \n\u201cThe Wedgwoodn\u2019t Tureen\u201d, which draws a correlation between the future of ceramic design and Josiah Wedgwood\u2019s role at a pivotal moment in the first wave of industrialized ceramic manufacturing in the late&amp;nbsp;eighteenth century, is a demonstration of the technology\u2019s circumvention of the material and technical limitations of ceramic. It is in the success of this initial piece that \u201cTall Green Bloom\u201d developed. Eden describes these new works as being the beginning of \u201ca new ceramic language...where the pre-industrial craft meets post-industrial manufacturing.\u201d\u201cTall Green Bloom\u201d, created using Additive Manufacturing (3-D printing), is part of a series&amp;nbsp;based on&amp;nbsp;iconic ceramic objects from the first industrial revolution that would be impossibile to&amp;nbsp;construct through traditional ceramic techniques. The artist intentionally uses complex structures and bright colors that are beyond the possibility of traditional ceramic materials. Eden's use of this technology to achieve these results shows a strong, clear&amp;nbsp;voice speaking to the world&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the new ceramic language of his own invention. &amp;nbsp;",
