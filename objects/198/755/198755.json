The red set includes: the king as a strapping blacksmith; the queen as a beautiful peasant woman, the bishops as Red Army soldiers, the knights as horse's heads, the rooks as boats with horse head-shaped prows and star-shaped sails, and the pawns as farm workers holding wheat sheafs and sickles. The white set includes: the king bearing a skeleton face and black robes, the queen holding a cornucopia spilling its gold coins, the bishops as caped and helmeted courtiers, the knights as caparisoned horse's heads, the rooks as swan boats with sheild-shaped sails, and pawns as workers bound in chains.",
