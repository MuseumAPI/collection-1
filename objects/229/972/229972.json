  "description": "The library interior shows elements of the Aesthetic Movement.  The furniture, including a fur-covered couch, bentwood chairs, and a bamboo armchair and writing table, located in the neighboring room on the left, is utilitarian.  The use of tiles on either side of the stained glass windows and of geometric-patterned walls are design components often seen in late nineteenth century England.\r\n\r\n",
