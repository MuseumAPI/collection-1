    "description": "This early drawing of the Getty complex layout shows the architect developing the orientation and regulating grids for the architecture which are based on the 22.5 degree angle of the San Diego Freeway as it comes from the south and bends to the north below the Center.   This is also the same angle of two intersecting ridges that run through the complex.  Superimposed on the two orientation lines Meier has set two grids on which he has begun to lay out a grouping of museum pavilions and a visitor arrival area.",
