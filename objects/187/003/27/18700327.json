    "justification":"Reflecting Well by Arai continues his life-long investigation of materials and textile techniques and transforming two-dimensional cloth into sculptural and vibrant surfaces.&amp;nbsp; In this piece which is comprised of polyester and aluminum, Arai combines a melt-off technique, which dissolves the metallic thread leaving behind a transparent cloth, and shibori, a type of tie-dyeing technique that, in Reflecting Well, ultimately protects the metallic areas when dyeing the cloth. The results are large, circular, metallic puckers that reflect light and create an incredibly animated cloth.&amp;nbsp; ",
