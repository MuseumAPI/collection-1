    "justification": "From the Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Hector Guimard (1867-1942) is considered to be one of the most prominent innovators of the art nouveau style.&amp;nbsp; Active in Paris from 1885 \u2013 1938 when he moved to New York, Guimard designed myriad decorative objects from ceramics to furniture fitting within the Gesamtkunstwerk of the art nouveau interior.&amp;nbsp; He is perhaps best known as the designer of the iconic Paris Metro station metalwork, however, his architectural design production was much more focused in domestic buildings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In addition to Guimard\u2019s interiors, his architectural works ranged from private residences to apartment and commercial buildings.&amp;nbsp; The building facades echoed their inventive interior spaces with curving, sinuous forms and architectural elements that fit within the vocabulary of art nouveau.&amp;nbsp; One such decorative element Guimard designed for building exteriors were balcony grilles, like the one proposed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \nThis&amp;nbsp; design was used in multiple Guimard constructions including an ensemble of buildings built from 1909-11with various different designs of balconies and grilles (from which this example comes)at&amp;nbsp; 17, 19, and 21 rue La Fontaine (Paris) and 8 and 10 rue Agar&amp;nbsp; the Tr\u00e9mois Building (Paris), H\u00f4tel Mezzara (60 rue La Fontaine, Paris), and the Villa at Eaubonne (16 rue Jean-Doyen, Eaubonne).&amp;nbsp; From private French residences to small pre-fabricated Parisian apartments, such cast-iron works were incorporated throughout several exterior schemes, emphasizing the variability of cast-iron, both as a decorative material and early example of mass-production.&amp;nbsp; During the 1960s, tenants in Guimard-designed buildings were allowed to change and remove the architectural metalwork, such as these balcony grilles, leading to the dissemination of some of the examples. Those that remained on the building can nolonger be removed.\nThe manufacturer responsible for producing Guimard\u2019s architectural metalwork was the Saint-Dizier foundry.&amp;nbsp; These grilles, therefore, serve as an excellent example of a design and industry collaboration resulting in the dissemination of a style that has left a unique mark on the history of design, and played an important role in early twentieth-century visual culture.&quot;",
