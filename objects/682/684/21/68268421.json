    "description": "Late Classic Saltillo serape with a brown field and a central aggregate diamond. Brown field has a repeating red dot pattern with a white wavy dot stripe on either side. Warp ends have multicolored stripes and short off-white fringe. Side borders are stacked, variegated rhombuses in red, purple, yellow-green, dark blue, and light blue.",
    "justification": "The Saltillo serape of northern Mexico represents the merging of cultures, art and weaving. Recognized as a product of indigenous and Spanish traditions, its true symbolic value rose during the course of the nineteenth century. These eye catching garments likely derived from an indigenous cape known as a tilma. While blanket-type garments were worn by men during the colonial period, the serape with a central motif and small repeating patterns on the&amp;nbsp;borders and field didn\u2019t emerge until the nineteenth century. It first gained notice when rural inhabitants and Mexican cowboys or vaqueros adopted it as part of their attire in the early 1800s. With their bright colors and dazzling central motif, serapes evolved by the mid-1800s into an important component of male fashion and were adopted by men across all classes. While the quality can vary, those woven in Saltillo were the finest, distinguished by a high thread count and complex patterning. Their rise in popularity also is closely connected to Mexican horsemanship, which became a national obsession after Independence. The horseman of this period with his wide-brimmed hat, silver-buttonned chaps&amp;nbsp;and colorful serape became the symbol of strength and self-sufficiency in the Independence period. \nThis Late Classic Saltillo serape is tapestry woven in two sections and stitched down the middle to form a long rectangle. The undyed cotton warp was machine spun while the wool wefts are handspun wool. The brown and cream-colored wool is undyed while the other colors were achieved using indigo and synthetic dyes. The central motif is known an \u201caggregate diamond,\u201d and the brown field has a red spot motif. The warp ends have bright multi-colored stripes while the side borders have a striking design of stacked, variegated rhombuses in bright hues. The aggregate diamond on a brown field makes this particular serape a rare example of late classic Saltillo weaving style. A similar example, reproduced in Saltillo Serapes: A Survey 1850-1920, is believed to have been woven in the same workshop, by the same weaver. &amp;nbsp;The overall condition is excellent with very little fading making it an excellent candidate for exhibition. The Saltillo serape has been on our Top 25 list for several years and would be a prized addition to the Textiles collection.",
