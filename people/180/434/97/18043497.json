    "biography": "Born into a family of decorative artists going back to the 17th century, Jean-Baptiste Huet trained with the animal painter Charles Dagomer (?-1766).  Probably through Dagomer, Huet was introduced to Gilles Demarteau, principal engraver for Francois Boucher.  After 1766 he continued his studies with one of Boucher's former students, Jean-Baptise Le Prince (1734-1781).  Huet was accepted as a member of the Royal Acdemy of Painting and Sculpture on July 29, 1769.  While he contiued to exhibit paintings regularly at the Salons, he spent the last thirty years (starting around 1785) of his life focused primarily on designing printed textiles for the Oberkampf Manufactury in Jouy-en-Josas, France.",
