    "description": "Horizontal sheet tipped vertically into binding depicting a view of the front and back of a wooden door with a profile of one of its diamond-shaped panels in the center of the sheet.  At left and right are the back and front of the door, respectively.  The upper section of the door shows a recessed diamond frame on which is the serpentine figure of a dragon breathing fire and surrounded by small flames with a crown suspended in the air above its head.  On the front of the door, the dragon faces the right; on the reaf of the door, the dragon faces to the left.  the lower half of the front door has another diamond-shaped panel that mimicks the one above, and scattered within it are more small flame carvings.  Raised, lozenge-shaped panels dominate the lower half of the door at left.  One lozenge has been drawn and is crossed by a line AB.  This line is drawn again in the center of the sheet and is the molding profile of the lozenge carving.",
