  "description": "Vertical sheet illustrating  a tile floor pattern.  Three bands of alternating brown and blue squares frame the lower right corner of tilework in shades of blue, white, and golden yellow.  The central tiles create a diamond pattern of alternating blue and white diamond-shaped tiles, tiles with a yellow fleur-de-lys on blue ground, and tiles with a yellow rosette and stylized yellow fleurs-de-lys radiating from the cardinal points. The colors are much more muted than those depicted in 1943-51-199.",
