  "description": "1993-151-131a [left-hand page] and 1993-151-131b [right-hand page] comprise a double-page advertisement headed An Investment [a] in Architecture [b], imprinted in a curved format. Six ideographs featuring architectural elements are scattered near the heading.\r\n\r\nAt the center of (a) is a photograph of the Memphis (condominiums) uptown building, headed On the East Side, and followed underneath by uptown/Memphis (in the logo style)/ 303 East 60th Street/ at the bridge/ two blocks from the river/ call/ 935-6030/ for a priority appointment. To the left of and aligned with the central image are three photographic views: topmost, on the extreme left, is a shopping bag, captioned Bloomingdale's celebrates \"Ecco Italia\"/ September 11 to November 3/ (courtesy Bloomingdales); middle, partly overlaying the central image, is the East 59th Street Bridge; and bottommost, also on the extreme left, is the building's entryway. Each photograph is accompanied by a paragraph composed of marketing information. The three-level photographic view and accompanying paragraph format is repeated to the right of the central image: topmost, on the extreme right, is a pattern of black and white bathroom tile squares; middle, partly overlaying the central image, is the building's rooftop; and bottommost, also on the right, is a neighborhood gymnasium club. Below this last image is a broken swirl, in a Memphis studio-style squiggle pattern, enclosing eight lines of pricing information.\r\nJust above the bottom edge of the page is a line of type referring to the widespread influence on other designers of the Memphis design studios.\r\n\r\nAt the center of (b) is a photograph of the Memphis (condominiums) downtown building, headed In the Village, and followed underneath by Memphis (in the logo style)/ downtown/ 140 Charles Street/ in Greenwich Village/ one block from the river/ call/ 645-1050/ for a priority appointment. To the left of and aligned with the central image are three photographic views: topmost, slightly above and partly \r\noverlapping the building view, is a neighborhood townhouse and trees; middle, on the extreme left, is a Hudson River scene; and bottommost, a kitchen sink faucet and two handles. Each photograph is accompanied by a marketing paragraph. Below the kitchen faucet image is a repeat of the swirl from (a), again enclosing pricing information. As in (a), the three-level photographic view and accompanying paragraph format is repeated to the right of the central image: topmost, on the extreme right, is an apartment floor plan; middle, slightly overlapping the central image, is one of the terrace rooftops of the building; and bottommost, is a peaked hat, apparently part of the building staff uniform, showing an M in the Memphis (condominiums) logo style. Just above the bottom edge, one line of type continues the Memphis design studios reference from (a).",
