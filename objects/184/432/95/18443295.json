Its dimensions were made to appear greater by extending the ceiling of the half-oval-shaped auditorium over part of the stage, completing the oval. The central stage opening alone could be open with the side spaces closed; the side stages could show different scenes; or the caryatids (apparently not real supports) could be removed to provide an even wider playing space.",
