    "biography": "Kayserzinn (1894-1925) was made by one of the most successful firms to produced Art Nouveau pewter ware during the turn of the twentieth century. It was a family-run factory \"J.P. Kayser Sohn\", and they produced other wares using Kayser & Sohn as a mark, but gave a specific name for the pewter \u201cKayserzinn\u201d, perhaps a play on the idea that it could be the Kaiser\u2019s \u2013or Emperor\u2019s-pewter. In 1894 Engelbert Kayser set up a design workshop that supplied around 800 different designs that were produced by the Krefeld, Germany, factory.",
