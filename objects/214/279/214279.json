  "description": "Stylized skull in black and white, clenching in its teeth a green branch with berries (olive branch), on dark blue background.  This anti-Vietnam war poster is a grim \"remake\" emphasizing the image of death, rather than a more traditional peace image of a dove with an olive branch in its beak.  The bold colors and the illusion of collage(through which the olive branch is \"segmented\" by the teeth of the skull) convey a deceptively simplistic, but powerful, propagandistic message .",
