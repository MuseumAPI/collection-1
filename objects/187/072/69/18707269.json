    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The firm of Allien became the Tinsel Trading Company at some point, and it was probably as the latter that they might have made various pieces of theatrical jewlry and other decorative accessories. The donor remembers her mother wearing the earrings and stated that came from teh family business which started making militry items and later manufactured theatrical items. \nThe earrings show the use of cut steel for a style of jewelry popular in precious stones as well. Here we see this material being cut with facets and pendant neo-classical style, enhancing our knowledge of American jewelry fashion fro the middle income levels and of the kinds of firms which produced it.&quot; ",
