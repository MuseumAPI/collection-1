At left and right, hard edged white rectangular forms suggest buildings while an irregular white line at center could suggest lightning. A bold white irregular stripe cuts across the lower pattern from left to right. A small white circle at right below center balances the composition. The letters MFA recede from left to right at upper center. Below this, two columns of text and one block of text at right in white.",
