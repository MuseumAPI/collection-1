    "justification":"\nThis shirtwaist day dress was designed by celebrated fashion designer Claire McCardell, who is noted for her important contribution to \u201cThe American Look\u201d of casual and active sportswear for women. It was made from a printed cotton fabric, Parade Sauvage, designed by Fernand L\u00e9ger, one of the most prominent, prolific, and influential modern artists of the early twentieth century. \nIn the post-World War II period, advocates for the American textile industry actively promoted ways for manufacturers to improve the design quality of their products. One outspoken champion, the magazine American Fabrics, encouraged manufacturers to find design inspiration in the collections of fine art to be found in museums. \u201cLet\u2019s have art in industry,\u201d they demanded.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> In 1953, Dan Fuller, President of Fuller Fabrics, went one step further. He bypassed the museums entirely and went directly to the studios of five of the twentieth century\u2019s most distinguished artists: Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Raoul Dufy. The groundbreaking collaboration between the American manufacturer and the five European masters resulted in the acclaimed Modern Masters Series. \nFuller\u2019s Modern Master Series was unique in America in the 1950s. The artists were not commissioned to produce original patterns specifically for the textiles. Instead, Dan Fuller worked personally with each artist to select motifs from their existing oeuvre that were then incorporated by the company\u2019s designers into repeating textile patterns. It was truly art by the yard for the masses.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> Fidelity of reproduction was essential and Fuller\u2019s designers worked diligently to successfully render the motifs in printable form. The patterns were designed to be roller printed rather than screen printed because the fabric was to be mass produced and sold at low price points, less than $2 a yard, for use by both garment manufacturers and home sewers. This was not haute couture, but rather modestly priced fabric for sportswear and casual clothes.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> \nEach artist approved the final patterns derived from his work and was involved in the selection of the colorways.&amp;nbsp; Every design was copyrighted. Engraving the rollers and printing the patterns on cloth was technically challenging and took more than a year to meet Fuller\u2019s high standards.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]<\/a> \nMarketing was a key element of the project \u2013 the Modern Master Series was launched in the fall of 1955 with a museum exhibition and documentary film that featured the artists in their studios, the original works of art, the finished fabrics, and the production process. The film and exhibition opened at the Brooklyn Museum and then traveled to other American Museums.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]<\/a> \nPublicity for the Modern Master Series also included a five-page editorial in Life Magazine, \u201cModern Art in Fashion.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]<\/a> Life\u2019s fashion editor Sally Kirkland enlisted the participation of her friend, designer Claire McCardell. McCardell designed a wardrobe of separates and dress ensembles using Modern Masters Fabrics which were featured in the Life photo essay, including the Parade Sauvage dress.<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]<\/a> \nThe Modern Masters Series was much celebrated when it was launched. American Fabrics applauded Fuller for its daring and courage in bridging \u201cthe abyss\u201d between fine and applied arts.<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]<\/a> The brilliant collaboration between Fuller and the artists was held up as an important example for other American textile manufacturers. Claire McCardell was an influential American mid-century ready-to-wear designer, and her fashions using Modern Masters fabrics added prestige to the collection. The fabrics were also a commercial success. In addition to McCardell, other prominent American sportswear designers and manufacturers like Adele Simpson and Lanz of California used the Modern Master Series.<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]<\/a>\nThe Museum currently holds&amp;nbsp;six fabrics from Fuller\u2019s Modern Masters Series in its collection, including one other by L\u00e9ger, Vitrail. The source motifs for most of these fabrics are conventional: for example, the fabric Birds by Picasso uses a figure of a bird taken from a painted ceramic plate.<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]<\/a> L\u00e9ger\u2019s designs, on the other hand, represent decidedly odd motifs for American sportswear fabrics. The motif for Vitrail is a monumental stained glass window that Leger designed for a Catholic Church in France, Pincers and Nails, depicting the instruments of Christ\u2019s passion. The motif for Parade Sauvage is even more curious.\nIn 1949, L\u00e9ger completed a series of fifteen lithographs for an illustrated edition of French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud\u2019s (1854-91) Illuminations (1874).<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]<\/a> Rimbaud was the influential enfant terrible of late nineteenth century French poetry, whose writing draws heavily on his rebellious and dissolute lifestyle. \nL\u00e9ger\u2019s lithograph Parade Sauvage is an illustration for \u201cParade,\u201d one of the prose poems in Illuminations. The joyful iconography of circus parades, including clowns and acrobats, appears frequently in L\u00e9ger\u2019s work, but the figures in Parade Sauvage are different. \u201cParade\u201d is a graphic and violent homoerotic poem and L\u00e9ger\u2019s illustration aligns with its more sinister imagery. The lithograph also contains the final line of the poem in French: \u201cJ\u2019ai seul la clef a cette parade sauvage,\u201c in L\u00e9ger\u2019s own hand.<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]<\/a> The lithograph in its entirety, with the calligraphy, was used as the motif for the Modern Masters fabric, in an offset repeat pattern. Consistent with L\u00e9ger\u2019s painting style, independent patches of bright colors in organic shapes are superimposed on the black and white lithograph design. The fabric was made in several different colorways.\nThe bold strokes of L\u00e9ger\u2019s complex black and white lithograph, combined with the bright colors, created a lively and appealing fashion fabric. The origin and meaning of the original motif, and the incongruity of its use in a cotton day dress for American middle class women, was apparently ignored at the time. In retrospect, there is a certain irony in Fuller Fabrics\u2019 advertising for the Modern Masters Series, which noted that L\u00e9ger\u2019s work \u201clends fashion its greatest surprise.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]<\/a> \n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> \u201c$780,000,000 worth of Design Ideas \u2013 Free!\u201d American Fabrics, 1 (Fall 1946): 80-87.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a> Geoffry Rayner, Richard Chamberlain and Annamarie Stapleton, Textile Design: Artists\u2019 Textiles 1940-76 (Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK: Antique Collectors Club, 2012), 139.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a> \u201cTrying Abstraction on Fabrics,\u201d ArtNews 54, issue 7 (November 1955): 43.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]<\/a> Ibid.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]<\/a> Ibid.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref6\">[6]<\/a> \u201cModern Art in Fashion,\u201d Life Magazine, November 14, 1955: 142-46.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref7\">[7]<\/a> Kohle Yohannan, and Nancy Nolf, Claire McCardell: Redefining Modernism (NY: Abrams, 1998), 126.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref8\">[8]<\/a> \u201cFine Art and Textiles come to Terms,\u201d American Fabrics 35 (Winter 1955-56): 49.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref9\">[9]<\/a> Rayner, 139.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref10\">[10]<\/a> Another Picasso fabric, Fish, also takes its motif from a painted ceramic.
