  "description": "The story of Belisarius, a Byzantine general who was victorious on the field of battle but falsely accused of conspiracy and disgraced, became very popular at the end of the 18th century after the publication of Belisaire by Marmontel in 1767. The central scene is after David's 1781 painting \"Belisarius.\" (Recognized by a soldier who had served under him at the moment a woman gives him alms.)\r\n",
