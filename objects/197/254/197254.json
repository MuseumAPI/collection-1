In the upper right and lower two quadrants are three line  illustrations of a lighted cigar, hand and car, one in each quadrant, representing the album's three songs, identified beneath the illustrations in small black capital letters. A fourth illustration of a man's head in the upper left quadrant, representing David Byrne, is accompanied by his name in red, also in small capitals, above the illustration, and by 45 RPM in black below. In the upper right quadrant on the same line and in identical type as the Byrne name is the album title.  \r\nVerso: The four quadrant illustrations are identical to the Recto, but instead of the song titles in capitals beneath the illustrations, there are titles and album production details in small upper and lower case type. \r\n",
