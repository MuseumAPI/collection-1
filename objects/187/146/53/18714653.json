    "description":"Roughly cylindrical form of thin paper layers fanned out to form chair; the front and top cut and shaped to form contoured seat, low arms, and back, the seat further compressed and contoured by designer sitting in chair.",
    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Context: Tokujin Yoshioka became known for his interiors and installation design, but has been exploring furniture and lighting design in recent years. He attended the Kuwasawa Design School, graduating in 1986, and collaborated with two major twentieth-century Japanese designers, the late Shiro Kuramata, and the innovative fashion designer Issey Miyake. In 1988, at the age of 21, Yoshioka was put in charge of Miyake's shop designs. He has also designed accessories for Miyake, and has collaborated with him on many projects, including his &quot;A-POC&quot; installation for the exhibition &quot;Issey Miyaki: Making Things,&quot; at the Cartier Foundation in Paris (1998). In 1992, Yoshioka started business as a freelance designer, and established his own studio in 2000. This past year, he received the Design Miami\/Designer of the Year Award, for his technically innovative work, &quot;\u2026developing imaginative methods of production completely unique in the field.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe Chair: Yoshioka has said that he is &quot;\u2026often inspired simply by the desire to use new materials or processes\u2026&quot; and does not start with form.&amp;nbsp; The Honey-Pop chair is such an exploration of material. It is made of tissue-thin glassine honeycomb paper used for Chinese paper lamps. Layers of paper are laid flat, stacked,&amp;nbsp; and a single curved cut is made to shape the back and seat.&amp;nbsp; The form fans out accordion style, into a surprisingly strong and durable structure. The final contours of the seat and back are created when the user first sits in the chair, making an imprint of his or her body in the honeycombed surface. Honey-Pop combines standardized manufacturing technique and end-user customization-- a growing trend in design.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
