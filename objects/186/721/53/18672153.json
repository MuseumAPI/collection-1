    "description": "Art exhibition poster.  On recto, at upper center, outline of rectangle, serving as floor plan, labeled \" VISUAL ARTS MUSEUM.\"  Each side of the plan is identified with  letters \"A\" through \"F\" and these correspond to elevations shown in a row below the plan. Each of the five wall elevations is divided into four sections (numbered 1-20); each elevation is labeled, from left to right: \"ARCS FROM CORNERS\" (1-4); ARCS FROM SIDES\" (5-8); \"STRAIGHT LINES\" (9-12); \"NON STRAIGHT LINES\" (13-16); and BROKEN LINES\" (17-20).  As a third row (white on black) is a gridded \"map\" where each square successively combines two lines; the whole shows all  possibilities of such combinations.  On the fourth row is a gridded band showing corresponding fractions (pairing two numerals from 1 to 20.)  At the bottom are two lines of text.",
