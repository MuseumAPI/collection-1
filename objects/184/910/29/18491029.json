    "description":"A sidewall fragment was repurposed for use here as a book cover.  The sidewall design consists of two horizontal registers of running leaves and small floral motifs separated by a band of small, rectangular-shaped forest-green checkerboards.  The upper register of leaves is highlighted with white and black flowers.  The lower register is composed entirely of small black and white flowers on vines.  In its original use, the sidewall would have probably been oriented 90 degrees counterclockwise with the larger section on the left side of the fragment.",
