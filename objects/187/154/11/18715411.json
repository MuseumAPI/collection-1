    "justification": "Massive Paisley, a contemporary interpretation of the paisley pattern, which is a tear drop or stylized cone-shaped motif that was popular in Kashmir shawls between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries, is designed by Maharam Design Studio. The Paisley pattern , named after the town in Scotland, which was the largest producer of imitations of these shawls, can be traced back to ancient Babylon, where a tear-drop shape was used as a symbol to represent the growing shoot of a date palm. The palm provided food, drink, clothing (woven fibers) and shelter, and so became regarded as the \u2018Tree of Life', with its growing shoot being gradually recognized as a fertility symbol. By the mid-nineteenth century demand in Europe for Kashmir shawls was enormous and could not be satisfied. Before 1850 one man would weave a shawl on a hand loom, but after this date several men or boys would weave a small section of a shawl, which would be cut out and pieced together, a patchwork of small pieces, and sewn into a shawl by a shawl tailor or rafugar. An order worked in this way could be completed in one-and-a-half months instead of the two to three years it would take to weave a shawl. Another even quicker method to increase production was to embroider shawls, either partially combining this technique with woven shawls or completely embroidering. Amazingly, with both these methods joins cannot be detected and the design flows over the whole shawl.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe scale of the paisley in Maharam\u2019s textile is many times larger than the traditional form, which makes it much more contemporary in its almost pop-like presentation.&amp;nbsp; The Textile department has a number of Kashmir shawls from the mid-19th century as well as other textiles with the paisley design. In addition, Wallcoverings and Product Design and Decorative Arts also have works with paisley designs. Massive Paisley is not only contemporary, but also reflective of the Museum\u2019s collection of the traditional design form. ",
