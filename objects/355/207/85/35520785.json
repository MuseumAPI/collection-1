Upper register: a horizontal plane in black and yellow stripes sandwiched by gray panels and supported by two pink legs; middle register: striped black panel supported by outlined panel and two outlined legs; lower register: two overlapping striped black panels sandwiching a gray panel supported by two legs and an abstract construct of a pink rectangle, jutting diagonally, supported by a yellow triangle and a blue arc.",
    "justification": "These two sheets of designs for tables date from the founding year of Memphis, the highly influential design collective, led by Ettore Sottsass, and including Michele de Lucchi, Matteo Thun, Marco Zanini, and Nathalie du Pasquier among others.&amp;nbsp; This group, which coalesced in response to the predominant modernist aesthetic, caused a sensation with their fun product designs and architecture in flamboyant colors and richly patterned surfaces in contrast to the cool, elegance of modern design.&amp;nbsp; These designs explore some playful ideas for a table, a leaning single column base buttressed by an arc-shaped support instead of a &quot;normal&quot; base as&amp;nbsp;the table\u2019s support system.&amp;nbsp; The black and white striped table top can be found in other products&amp;nbsp;Michele de&amp;nbsp;Lucchi designed for Memphis such as the Oceanic Table Lamp and Flamingo Side Table.&amp;nbsp; The base motif appears to have inspired the 1980s Tea Kettle design by Matteo Thun.",
