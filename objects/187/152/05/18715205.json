    "justification":"from aquisition file:\nTo find uses for existing instant photography technology, and with digital photography on the horizon, Polaroid developed the PolaPulse as a disposable flashlight use the then 25-year-old zinc carbon battery technology of Polaroid's instant camera packs. The thin PolaPulse flashlight was designed to shed light over a five foor area, and was intended as a convenient way to illuminate, at close range, objects such as a car door keyhole. It was sized to be operate by one hand, and to fit into a shirt pocket, car glove compartment, purse or backpack. Although the battery has a life of about five years, the manufacturer did not design the housing&amp;nbsp;to open so the consumer could replace the battery. the owner was to dispose of the entire flashlight and simply purchase another.
