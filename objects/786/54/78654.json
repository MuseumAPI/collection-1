Clockwise from top right is a finial created by four layers of oak leaves attached in gradually smaller tiers cuving upward against a pillar.  Below this is a small dormer with simple ball finial, and at left is the largest sketch on the page, an elevation of medieval or Renaissance-period house seen from a corner.  The house has a slightly overhanging second story and visible beams below the steeply pitched roof.  The roof on its left side has two ball finials at either end and a small dormer at its eave below.  The windows have small balconies made of crossed uprights.",
