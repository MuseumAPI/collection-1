    "justification": "This model of the Temple of Nike Apteros was commissioned from the designer-makers by the donor based on the high quality of its woodworking skills. It shows rustication&amp;nbsp; through cut lines, and very precisely cut and joined elements. It is an example of a collector's model to display craftsmanship and design. In this case, as with many models, it is a way to collect architecture and shows the never-ending inspiration of classical architecture on people of all eras, even up to the present day. It is also a way to collect architecture-to study the details of what this temple must have looked like in pristene condition.&amp;nbsp;",
