  "description": "Hand-woven sample for drapery material in a checkerboard of horizontal rectangles of orange and grey-green with an overall vertical stripe effect.   The warp is of white cotton used in pairs, bound with single wefts of orange boucle yarn or paired wefts of one gray-green cotton with one gold metallic thread.  The lighter bands are double cloth with a pocketed structure; in the darker bands the two layers are locked together in a taquete structure. The vertical stripe effect is caused by the exchange of wefts from one face to the other.",
