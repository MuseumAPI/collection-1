  "description": "Eight slats, attached vertically by thin black cord about three inches in from the left and right edges, comprise this promotional mobile for a record album titled The Name of This Band is Talking Heads. Just above the bottom edge of the eighth slat on both recto and verso, one line of type in small white capitals contains the names of the record producers and object photographers.\r\n\r\nRecto: When the object is folded, only slat number 1 is visible: The Name Of This Band Is/Talking Heads, imprinted in gold white sans serif style capitals on a red ground. When unfolded, all eight slats are visible. Number 6 is identical to number 1. The remaining slats feature color photographic reproductions of four of the band's musicians performing on their instuments (2-5), along with two audience members seated in the lower right hand corner (7-8). White tied-back curtains and a framed print hung on the white wall point to the performance taking place in a domestic venue.\r\n",
