    "description": "The coverlet is comprised of three breadths of fine undyed cotton plain weave, with very fine silk chain-stitch embroidery in brown, violet, two shades of blue, yellow and two shades of pink, lined with plain cotton. \nThe design is similar to 1953-123-1, but composed for a coverlet: the flowering branches fill the field, but the rockery and its figures appear at the bottom and reversed at the top. In the center, a medallion filled with a miniature pattern of flowering vines framing a pair of plying birds. The same elements are used in the four corners, but with a single bird. The whole is framed by a wide border and two narrow guard borders with flowering vines. At one end the border is largely missing. The design is simplified in detail and bolder in color than the chintz.",
