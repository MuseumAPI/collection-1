  "description": "1993-151-33a - Ruler: Fabricated of blond wood and edged in brass-colored metal, the twelve inch ruler is marked off at one-inch intervals by the numerals 1-12 and by black lines, to the right of the numerals, extending downward about halfway. The message, Cheers from M&Co, is imprinted in small black capitals and is positioned underneath in the space between the numerals 5 and 7.\r\n\r\n1993-151-33b - Wrapper: Two vertical slots are incised in each end of the principal surface, so that the two end flaps may be inserted in order to form a pyramidally-shaped container. A black and white illustration of the Eiffel Tower within an oval shape is centered on this surface. With the object turned so that the principal surface is now on bottom, the viewer faces a second surface, showing a quotation in the center, Imagination is more important than knowledge, from Albert Einstein, whose name is imprinted beneath in serif-style capitals. The third surface is blank, except for a vertical line of type along the left edge identifying the M&Co name and address.",
