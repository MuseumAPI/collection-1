    "biography": "American jeweler Leslie Leupp received his B.A. in art from Bethel College (1968) and his M.F.A in Metalsmithing and Jewelry design from Indiana University (1973).  He held teaching positions at various universities and starting in 1988, directed the Metal Arts program in the School of Visual Arts at Penn State University. Leupp\u2019s practice reflected his belief that, \u201cobjects empower people.\u201d Instead of rendering the user a passive wearer, Leupp\u2019s kinetic pieces invite the user to interact with them. His jewelry relates to the body and encourages the user to make choices about how to wear such pieces. His work is considered to be sophisticated, unconventional and influential, and has been included in national and international exhibitions and published in numerous seminal jewelry texts.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.personal.psu.edu\/faculty\/l\/g\/lgl3\/biography.html\nSusan Grant Lewin.
