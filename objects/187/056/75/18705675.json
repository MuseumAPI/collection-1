    "description": "Image consists of an immense gloved hand half covering and obscuring the smiling face of a young woman on the left. Her face is swathed in a unified brown tone that underscores the graphic flatness of the poster. Behind her to the left, a lone ski-lift seat swings above the distant peaks of the Alps at Engleberg, Switzerland, specifically the ski run Tr\u00fcbsee, identified by the sans-serif letters at the upper right. The star motif emblazoned on the glove is subtly echoed by the linear stars that seem to hover at the lower right, across the glove itself and finally, just below the tram in the air at the upper left.",
