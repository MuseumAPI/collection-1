    "justification": "\nIn 2012 Jianping He\u2019s work was featured in a solo exhibition at the NLD Gallery in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He, who moved to Berlin in 1996 to study and ultimately settled in Germany, has often reflected on his bridged relationship between the East and the West. The title of the exhibition, &quot;In-Between He Jianping&quot; was a nod to this feeling of designing in both worlds. For this poster, He made the bridge literal, creating a visual link between the first letter of every word or date and the remainder of the text with a stroke of loosely applied ink or paint. ",
