  "description": "This view, in the upper part of the page, shows a woman's head in left profile: eye closed; nose tilted upward; lips slightly parted; and hair arranged in waves and pulled back in what may be a bun. An earring peeks through the hair, but no ear is visible. The hair and earring are depicted in blue, and a broken-curved blue line, lightly sketched, extends from the vertical line, also lightly drawn, indicating the back of the neck.",
