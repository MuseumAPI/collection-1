    "description":"Triangular cut-out shapes in gelatin-infused cream felt chair structure that repeats the triangular form and is based on the shape of a crumpled used handkerchief.",
    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Louise Campbell, the daughter of a Danish father and an English mother, grew up and was educated in both countries. After receiving her degree from the London College of Furniture in 1992, she returned to Denmark to further her studies in Industrial Design at Denmark's Design School, graduating in 1995.&amp;nbsp; In 1996, she set up her own studio, from which she has worked independently since, focusing on furniture and lighting design, with increasing additional involvement in other product and interior design projects.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe &quot;Bless You&quot; chair is a one-off production, that combines technical felt making, an understanding of structure, with an individual approach which the designer feels includes her femininity.&amp;nbsp; The form, inspired by a crumpled handkerchief, is achieved by suspending a gelatin-soaked single sheet of felt from a carefully plotted group of strings.&amp;nbsp; The designer's statement reflects her thought processes:\n&amp;nbsp;&quot;My cold fingers take out the fine pocket handkerchief. I manage to give the newly ironed square an admiring glance before putting it to work on my November sneeze. Now crumpled, it is returned to my overcoat pocket with a brand new texture. Three sniffly months later I have fumbled my way to this easy chair.&quot;\nThe chair's shape both suggests the source of inspiration and its intended function, the latter dependent on a firmness imparted by the compressed dried gelatin.&amp;nbsp; The cut-outs add a playful and visual lightness both, while keeping the weight of the arms from becoming a structural liability.&amp;nbsp; This design and its use of cut felt served as a prototype for Campbell's subsequent Prince chair, designed in 2001 for an invitational competition for Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark. Prince, put into production in 2005, incorporates cut-outs and felt, but relies on water-jet cutting and lamination to a rubber substrate for its production.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
