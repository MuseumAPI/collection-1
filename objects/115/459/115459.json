  "description": "The present black and white photograph displays a round jar with a screw-on lid. The lid design features three small spirals placed at the center as if marking the points of a triangle; between the spirals, Bennetts, etched horizontally, radiates three times to the rim. A label affixed to the jar is imprinted Silver/ Bennetts/ Polish, with silver and polish in the designer's hand-lettered style type, in silver on black, and Bennetts in smaller stencil-style type in black on silver; spiral designs flank silver and polish on the left and right. Two lines of instructions regarding use of the product are imprinted in small sans-serif capitals in black on silver on the bottom row of the label. \r\n\r\nThe silver-and-black color scheme has been confirmed by an actual label present in the Gustav Jensen inventory.",
