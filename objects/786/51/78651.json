Visible are a large round tower at left, two large Romanesque towers with steeples to the right of this, and a few larger, lower rectangular structures with turrets a short distance to the right of the center towers.  To the very far right and closer to the foreground is a belltower with domed cupola.  There is a stand of trees in the foreground, and repeated rows of these trees which create a boundary from the foreground and the town in the distance.",
