    "description": "A) Near the entire left edge and at some part of the lower edge are figures of accounts. Above the left are two men, one of them a youngster lifting a trunk. The boy is seen from the fronside and the other from the right beneath. The motif of his legs has been changed. In the center is the group of four mules with saddles and the upper part of a man is visible behind them. B) At the reverse is vertically above a project of an architectural frame of a picture, probably for an altar. The left is executed; the right one only half partly outlined. Beside, at left, is another project for the entablature. Below, at the edge, is horizontally part of an account for the year 1632 or 1633 or 1633 and 1634. 1633 is mentioned regulalrly as \"grain,\" \"olives,\" \"mezzasoma,\" sometimes \"Bisola\" (measure of weight). Evidently five months or terms are spoken of and probably deliveries or receipts accounted for.",
