  "description": "The jacket background is glossy orange paper. Recto: the book title, Animal Liberation, is imprinted on two lines, margins justified, in sans serif type in a botanical pattern in dark red tones with beige highlights. The author's name, in the same pattern but in slightly smaller font size, appears directly underneath on a third line. In the lower half, not far from the bottom edge, second edition is imprinted in small, black lower case type. Verso: In the same type as on the recto, but in black: The Modern, in large size type, is followed by one long paragraph of copy in gradually decreasing font size, ending at center page; the font changes from upper case to upper and lower mid-paragraph. The remainder of the page displays testimonials. Spine: Book title, in the botanical pattern, and author's name, in black, are imprinted sideways. Three lines of miniscule black type, imprinted horizontally near the top edge, in the center and near the bottom edge complete the design.\r\n",
