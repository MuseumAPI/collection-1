    "biography": "George A. Hearn, a dry goods merchant and art collector, was a prominent donor and patron to many museums. His wife was a close friend of Sarah and Eleanor's mother. Despite the Hewitt sisters\u2019 long resistance to having a board of trustees peeking over their shoulders, Hearn advocated forcefully for the creation of a museum council to advise and help fund the collections, and he eventually prevailed. This farsighted choice not only lent the museum standing among the city\u2019s cultural institutions, it also formalized the organization\u2019s network of elite donors. From its inception, the committee featured the wealthiest benefactors of New York alongside\u2014at the insistence of the sisters\u2014prominent artists like Louis Comfort Tiffany and Daniel Chester French. Throughout his life, Hearn donated drawings, textiles, and decorative arts objects, and he also regularly gave money with no conditions attached, allowing the museum to develop its collection and attend to its practical needs during its earliest decades.",
