    "biography": "After a formative trip to Africa, Pasquier returned to France and began to explore elements of visual culture and to make her first images. In 1978 Pasquier moved to Milan where her artistic focus shifted to design. She was a founding member of the seminal design group Memphis, whose central figure was the architect Ettore Sottsass. During her formative years she designed brightly colored geometric and asymmetrical fabrics, rugs, objects and furniture which were characteristic of the ephemeral Memphis style. When the group dissolved in 1987 du Pasquier began to concentrate primarily on painting and exhibiting her work. The ancient tradition of Chinese painting was a great interest of Pasquier and played a role in her work from 1988 onwards. In 1998 she moved to a new studio with more light and space and the scale of her paintings increased. Her work became less colorful and less narrative during these later years. In attempts to counteract the silence of her later works Pasquier incorporated traces of the human presence into her images.  \nShe was an in resident artist at Galleria Antonio Colombo Milan and at Le Cadre Gallery, Hong Kong. She also collaborated on works at Limoges at CRAFT. \n\nExhibitions: Annual since 1989, Le Cadre Gallery, Hong Kong; Galleria Jannone, Milan, 1987, 1994; FruitMarket Gallery, Edinburgh, 1993; Galleria Corraini, Mantua, 1996; Fenderesky Gallery, Belfast, 1997; Galleria Colombo of Contemporary Art, Milan, 1996, 1998.\nSource: www.futurarium.com, 2001.",
