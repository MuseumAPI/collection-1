After obtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree in product design from The Iceland Academy of the Arts, he enrolled in ECAL (University of Art and Design) in Lausanne, Switzerland, and went on to teach there for several years. Sigur\u00f0arson believes that the function of an object\u2019s decorative and sculptural elements can be utilitarian, intellectual, or emotional. Currently based in Lausanne and Berlin, Sigur\u00f0arson credits his years of living abroad with expanding his understanding of beauty, including a renewed appreciation for his home country, Iceland.",
