    "biography": "Luigi Caccia Dominioni graduated from the architecture program of the Milan Politecnico in 1936. After his studies,  he collaborated with Livio and Pier Castiglioni in Venice. Dominioni and the Castiglioni brothers produced varied and innovative designs, which included silver and aluminum flatware, and the Phonola Bakelite-housed Model 547 radio, which won a gold medal at the VII Milan Triennale. Because opportunities were limited in Italy due to the Second World War, Dominioni pursued his career in Switzerland between 1943 and 1945, working as an intern and advertising illustrator. \n\nThe year 1947 was a banner year for Dominioni:  he opened his own architecture and design practice and cofounded the design store and manufacturer Azucena with Corrado Corradi Deli\u2019Acqua and Ignazio Gardelia. Azucena produces and sells sleek, seductive contemporary furniture, and is still in operation. \n\nDominioni is especially known for his eclecticism, particularly evident during the late 1950s when he designed restaurants, interiors and ceramic tiles for Cooperativa Ceramica. Between 1975 and 1982, he was also active in architecture and design in Monaco. A few of his signature architectural projects include: the Premio Compasso d\u2019Oro (apartment in QT8 project) in 1947, the Instituto della Beata Vergine Addolorata (1957-1960), and the Vanoni Library, Morbegno (1965-1966).",
