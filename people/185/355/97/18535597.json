    "biography":"Helen Kramer is best known for her handwoven drapery and upholstery. In the 1930s, she attended the Traphagen School of Design in New York, studying costume design. She traveled through Europe where she studied handweaving and fabric design. She liked to experiment with color. Kramer opened a showroom on Madison Avenue in New York, and then she and her brother, Boris, began working together under the brand name, Cromwell. During the early 1940s, she accompanied her husband, a doctor, to the Ashford General Hospital, where she launched a training program for occupational therapists to teach weaving. After the war, she opened a studio on Lexington Avenue.",
