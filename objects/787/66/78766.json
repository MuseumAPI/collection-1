  "description": "Vertical sheet depicting the clock tower of the Church of Sainte-Catherine in Honfleur from the front, rear, in plan, and with an elevation of the interior belfry structure.  The prominent tower is buttressed from all sides by large timbers that sit into the roof of the first story.  The first story is masonry with half-timber and plaster above.  The earliest parts of the building are in a late medieval or early Renaissance manner.  The main facade of the church's tower has a clock below the second louvered opening of the belfry.  Above the plan of the church is the drawing of a finial with a cock, meant to be on the top of the tower at left but there was no room to draw it.",
