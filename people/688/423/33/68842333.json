    "biography": "Formafantasma is a design firm based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and co-founded by the Italian duo Andrea Trimarchi (1983) and Simone Farresin (1980). The two designers began collaborating on illustrations for books and magazines while completing their BA in communication design. Their interest in product design developed while completing their MA at the Design Academy Eindhoven, where they graduated in July 2009 with a thesis based on traditional Sicilian folk craft.  \n\nFormafantasma\u2019s work explores such issues as the role of design in folk craft, the relationship between tradition and local culture, critical approaches to sustainability and the significance of objects as cultural conduits. They identify their role as the bridge between craft, industry, object and user and seek to stimulate a more critical and conceptual design dialogue through their work. Their works can be found in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, The Art Institute of Chicago, Vitra Design Museum, the Textile Museum in Tilburg, and Stedelijk Museum Den Bosch among others.",
