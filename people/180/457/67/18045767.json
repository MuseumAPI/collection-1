    "biography": "Alexander Julian is a notable American menswear and interior designer. Julian spent his early summers working at his father\u2019s clothing store and at the age of nineteen Julian left school at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to open a clothing store of his own. In the early 1970\u2019s Julian set out to modernize traditional menswear by designing innovative silhouettes and fabrics, and by introducing new colors into the common vernacular of menswear. For example Julian has created iterations of classic argyle diamonds and herringbone patterns and applied these to everything from sweaters and ties to table tops and ceilings designs. In 1975 Julian moved to New York and opened his company. Julian is best known for his line Colours, which introduced bold color into menswear while maintaining a sense of composure and confidence. Julian designs fashion and home furnishings that are functional, decorative, and expressive. His collections are distinctly American and promote a sense of classic, comfortable elegance. Julian has won five Coty Awards for design during his career, the first of which he was awarded before the age of thirty, and has been listed nine times on the International Best Dressed List.",
