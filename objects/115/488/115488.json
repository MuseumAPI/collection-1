  "description": "Placed in the center and extending into the right half of the sheet, the larger head, male, is heavily outlined in the profile, especially in the nose and chin. The lips are prominent as well. The eye, barely open, is downcast. Shading is concentrated outside the nose, around the eye and on the cheek. A second head, female, overlays the larger one in the upper left hand corner. This is a lightly sketched view depicting hair curls next to the cheek and faint shadows around the cheekbone and above the eye. A thin diagonal line slants upward from the left ear (not visible) to the forehead.",
