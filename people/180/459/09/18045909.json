    "biography": "Bush-Brown grew up on the Hudson, near Newburg, NY, and studied art at the Pratt Institute. She is best known for her tapestries, which were extremely popular during her lifetime.  She would combine stenciling, block-printing and embroidery on brightly colored silks, creating lovely mural silks, as she called them. Although she employed the batik technique of wax resist dyeing, she did not see her work as having traditional qualities. Her works were exhibited all over the United States, including the Pan-American Exhibition, the Ehrich Gallery, the Architectural League, the National Arts Club, and other venues. Bush-Brown\u2019s process was to observe nature and then sketch her ideas, which were then transferred to the fabric with wax. She was inspired by her international travels, which included Mexico, Europe, and the Near East.",
