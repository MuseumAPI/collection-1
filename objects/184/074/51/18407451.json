Flanking, a plaque inscribed: Gardens \/ are works of art \/ rather than of nature. To left, a large urn, chains and picks. At right a shovel, watering can, rake and telescope on a tripod. Below is a rock formation inscribed: Designs that are vast \/ only by their dimensions, are always \/ the sign of a common and low imagination; No work of art can be great but as it deceives \/ to be otherwise is the prerogative of nature only",
