  "description": "Displaying a combination of Neo-Gothic and Jacobean styles, this red room reflects the influence of Karl-Friedrich Schinkel's design books that were available from the 1820's onward. Chairs, cabinets-on-stand, tables and a harpsichord are late Renaissance in style. Chandeliers are Neo-Gothic in the manner of A. W. Pugin. The upper panes of the windows are inset with heraldic motifs, and tasselled pelmets create a valance across the top. A central medallion and floral-and-leaf pattern comprise a carpet in the Neo-Classical style.",
