    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification: \n&amp;nbsp;\n&quot;The Porca Miseria lamp is among the most recognizable and expressive of Ingo Maurer's lighting designs. Maurer is one of the most creative and respected lighting artist\/designers working today. Fascinated by what he calls the &quot;magical and mystical&quot; properties of light, Maurer constructs luminous atmospheres that play with traditional concepts of color, brightness, and shadow. Trained as a typographer and graphic artist, Maurer worked as a designer in the United States for Kayser Aluminum and IBM in 1960. He returned to Europe in 1963, where he was active as a graphic designer. The initial trigger for Maurer's transition to lighting design was his fascination with the light bulb as the &quot;perfect union of technology and poetry.&quot; Since then, he has created more than 150 different lights and lighting systems for diverse international venues, including fashion runways, public buildings and monuments, and private commissions. Combining unexpected materials and found objects with various light sources, Maurer is a pioneer in the use of new lighting technologies and imaginative production techniques.\n&amp;nbsp;\nPorca Miseria came about through a 1990 commission to design light sculptures for the owners of the Villa Wacker, on Lake Constance, a late 19th-century structure with interiors by Peter Behrens, one of the most important German Jugendstil designers. Among Maurer's final pieces was the dining-table lamp for the owners' cool sober contemporary kitchen, the social center of the house. Considering his first effort, made of paper, unsuccessful, Maurer eventually created an object made up of seemingly flying broken plates and cups that developed an intricate play of light and shadow, and expressed energy, disorder, even cheekiness, as an antidote to the spare, ordered space. The unnamed lamp, evocative of an explosion in a china closet, was constructed of shards of broken white dishes, cups, and pieces of cutlery attached to a structure composed of metal rods radiating from a central lighting element.&amp;nbsp; About four years later, in 1994, Maurer created the next, more complex and dynamic version, which he showed at the Euroluce, in Milan. Also a fan of cinematic explosions, Maurer first named the light Zabriskie Point, after the movie in which director Michelangelo Antonioni blew up a castle in slow motion. When one Italian visitor saw the broken, exploded shards and cutlery, his first comment included the phrase &quot;porca miseria&quot; (literally &quot;miserable pig&quot;, but loosely translates as &quot;what a disaster!&quot;), and the delighted Maurer changed the name. Despite the spontaneous look of the piece, it takes laborious fabrication to make one. There is a limited production of about ten each year, each lamp requiring the work of four people for about one week. Ceramic wares are dropped or smashed with a hammer, then the pieces, some as-is, others further broken and smoothed to more appropriate sizes and shapes, are composed and mounted onto an armature. Each lamp is a unique version of Maurer's riotous design.&quot;",
