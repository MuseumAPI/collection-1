    "description": "Image of milk bottle with text, using milk metaphor for manager recreuitment message. On a tan background, a beige milk bottle stands on a checker pattern in turquoise and mustard yellow. Bottle cap with the same checker pattern and orange. At center, a circular \u201clabel\u201d on milk bottle reads: Milk. An orange cow is in two parts. Below: T. G. I. F R I D A Y\u2019 S. In turquoise at the top of the bottle: The cream always rises to the top, as the old \/ saying goes. Now we\u2019re looking for the \/ cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me \u2013 the best of the best - \/ among us. Because we need more good \/ managers with the ability it takes to \/ effectively motivate and supervise people. \/ We know we can skim off that kind of talent \/ right here in house \u2013 and not just among our \/ department heads. After all each and every \/ one of you are responsible for our phenomenally \/ successful operation. And it\u2019s a fact that over 70% \/ of Friday\u2019s managers were once hourly employees. \/ So if you\u2019re the kind of person who can really deliver, \/ think about becoming a Friday\u2019s manager. Because \/ although we\u2019re filled with the very best, there\u2019s still a little \/ room at the top. \/ Talk to your General Manager or call the Personnel Office in Dallas, \/ (214) 233-2900, for details.",
