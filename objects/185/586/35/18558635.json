    "description": "A dado is shown at the bottom. On top is a frieze between bands with rosettes. The frieze consists of a high band between two low ones of different height. The high band shows rosettes in circular medallions, from which palmettes grow laterally, alternating with a stylized plant. Above the frieze is an entablature of several moldings, the lowest of which is colored. An ornamentation is alternatively suggested for it in the left half. The wall panel is divided into oblong panels framed by fillets and separated from each other by stripes, the lower parts of which show in the middle a white line, from which leaves and seeds grow in the upper parts. A hanging palmette frieze is alternatively suggested as a decoration of the tops of the oblong panels.",
