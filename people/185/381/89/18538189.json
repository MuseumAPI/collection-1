    "biography": "Warren Platner was born in Baltimore and studied architecture at Cornell University, where he graduated in 1941. He went on to work with legendary architects Raymond Loewy, Eero Saarinen, and I. M. Pei before opening his own architecture practice in 1967 in New Haven. The studio also designed furniture, lighting and textiles as well as residential and commercial interiors.  Platner made notable architectural contributions throughout his career, including the Ford Foundation interior (with architect Kevin Roche), Georg Jensen Design Center, and the Windows on the World restaurant in the World Trade Center, all in New York City.  He also earned an international reputation for the steel wire furniture he designed for Knoll, now an icon of 1960s modernism.",
