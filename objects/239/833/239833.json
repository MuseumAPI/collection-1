And thou has given us in love, O Lord our God, this Day of Memorial, a day of blowing the Shofar, an holy convocation, as a memorial of the departure from Egypt. For thou hast chosen us and hast sanctified us above all nations; and thy word in truth and endureth forever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, King over all the earth, who sanctifiest Israel and the Day of Memorial. \r\nFaiber Edel of K. W.
