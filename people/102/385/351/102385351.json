    "biography": "Printex was founded by Vera Neumann (1907-1993) and her husband George Neumann in 1946 along with their partner Werner Hamm. \nVera Neumann (born Salaff) was an artist turned textile designer, who graduated from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1948. A prolific designer, she was known for her distinctive bold colored patterns on linen and for her scarf line produced under the name Vera.  \nThe couple started their studio in their own apartment on 57th street in New York. They first developed interior decoration textile collections, working on silk-screen prints for table linen. In the World War II period the designer used parachute silk, which she used to create her scarves.\nPrintex became a successful company and it reached the stage of an industrial-scale production.  The Neumann\u2019s bought a mansion in Ossining, NY in 1948, where they set up their studio, their manufacture, and their own house.\nGeorge Neumann passed away in 1962. Printex and Vera Licensing were sold to Manhattan Industries in 1967. It was sold again to Salant Corporation in 1988 and Printex closed this same year.",
