Above, a relief panel and a semi-circular columned niche with a statue of a stand-female figure before a drapery. Atalantes at either side and seated griffins above. At top, a medallion supported by flying half-figures, above which are winged female figures bearing trumpets and wreaths, flanking a lyre. Arabesque tendrils connect the various parts.
