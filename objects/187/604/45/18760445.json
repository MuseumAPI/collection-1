    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Yoshioka first became known for his interiors and installation design, but has been exploring lighting and furniture design over the last ten years. After graduating from the Kuwasawa Design School in 1986, he collaborated with two seminal twentieth-century Japanese designers, the late Shiro Kuramata, and fashion designer Issey Miyake. At the age of 21, Yoshioka was in charge of Miyake's shop designs. He also designed accessories for Miyake, and has collaborated with him on many projects, including his 1998 &quot;A-POC&quot; installation for the exhibition &quot;Issey Miyake: Making Things,&quot; at the Cartier Foundation in Paris. In 1992, Yoshioka started business as a freelance designer, and by 2000 established his own studio. In 2008 he received the Design Miami\/Designer of the Year Award, for his technically innovative work, &quot;\u2026developing imaginative methods of production completely unique in the field.&quot; Yoshioka has said that he is &quot;\u2026often inspired simply by the desire to use new materials or processes\u2026&quot; and does not start with form.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The ToFU lamp is fabricated by means of a &quot;delicate manufacturing and cutting technique&quot; somewhat similar to the process used to make the Japanese soy-based food of the same name. Here, methacrylate resin is poured into a mold, allowed to set, and then cut to create a perfectly symmetrical square form into which a halogen light is inserted on one side. Yoshioka's design fully exploits the light conducting potential of the material. When turned on, the light is transmitted through the acrylic and illuminates the edges of the slab. The material seems to fade into the surrounding space, and takes on the appearance of a glowing square of light. In the spare form of this design, Yoshioka combines the jewel-like polymer with a structural simplicity that is rooted in Japanese aesthetic. In contrast to a Western emphasis on utility and shape, this functional object seems equally concerned with the conceptual interplay between the object and the space surrounding it--with the presence, and absence, of light and form.&quot;",
