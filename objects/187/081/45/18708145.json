    "description":"This salon was probably located in a house in northern Europe. The ceiling motif of musical instruments suggests that the salon was intended for a music room. Intricate ceiling and wall moldings reflect Neo-Classical and Rococo motifs.  Moresque influence is seen in the tablecloths, screens and rug, this last partially-viewed in the foreground. Comfortable furniture, potted plants, the grouping of small pictures on the right wall and fringed white tieback curtains create a Victorian room, curious in detail.",
