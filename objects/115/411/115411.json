  "description": "Depicted in white on a black background, the design has the appearance of an illuminated object, perhaps intended for display in the client's offices or retail establishment, and for adaptation to printed matter. Within a circle formed by four thick, equal bands broken by four circles at the top, bottom and sides, the company logo, Nolde and Horst Fine Hosiery, comprised of two semi-circles,  is imprinted in capitals in a stencil-styled type. In the center, an abstract symbol formed by an unbroken, curved line, completes the design.",
