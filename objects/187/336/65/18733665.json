He is surrounded by elements of the Swiss landscape including a dairy cow and pastures; an accordian, a pocket watch, Swiss flag, an artist's palette, and mountain tops. Enclosed in the bottom of the plinth is a train which may reflect the Vitznau-Rigi Bahn, the world's first cogwheel railway, built in 1871.",
