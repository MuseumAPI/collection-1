Pedestals on either side support two candle brackets with burning candles and two putti. Above, a broken pediment supports a putto sitting at left and holding a medallion of the King. Two additional putti support the crown. All is adorned with festoons and swags. Below are groups of men, of whom one is extinguishing a candle and another is walking with new lights. At right, two women appear, one running and the other accompanied by a dog.",
