    "description": "Design is incomplete.  A shield shape with blue border frames a jar from which springs a flowering vine of naturalistic small flowers. Large, actively curving leaves (possibly fern?) in red, purple, some in blue, several with strong blue stems and exhibiting fine inner decoration.  Narrow, spear-shaped leaves project and cross heavy foliage; very fine curving line in brownish-purple outlines the whole design, drawn about 1\/4 inch from the pattern.\nColors: Two reds, blue, two purples; some yellow appears in narrow lines outlining inner decoration in red leaves, but has disappeared from larger leaves, which are now blue.",
