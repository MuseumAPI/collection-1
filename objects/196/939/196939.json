  "description": "Letterhead - Within a small black rectangle in the top right-hand corner, Collective for Living Cinema is imprinted in white capital letters, sans-serif style. The name is displayed in disjointed style: Collec/ Ctive/ for/ Living/ Cinema, with letters cut off at the right and left edges. After a brief block of space underneath, the organization's name and address are imprinted on seven lines, followed by another block of space. Underneath that, in the lower half of the page, the remaining space consists of titles and names of organization personnel.\r\n\r\nEnvelope - The letterhead rectangle is repeated in the top left hand corner. Just above the bottom edge, aligned with the rectangle, the address is imprinted on two lines.\r\n\r\nBusiness card - Again, the rectangle appeaars, now on the left, occupying most of the space from top to bottom. To the right, Audrey Chang/ Workshop Tour Director, separated by a brief white space from three lines of address and phone number, completes the design.",
