    "justification":"justification from acquisition file:\nThe &quot;Wiggle&quot; stool is part of architect Frank Gehry's &quot;Easy Edges&quot; furniture series. In creating his laminated cardboard furniture, Gehry said his intent was to make &quot;the Volkswagen of furniture&quot; utilizing a material that was inexpensive and easy to work with. However, rather than folding cardboard into boxy forms, Gehry was inspired by the layered construction of architects models and worked with the material in laminated layers as if it were a solid. He used the exposed edges as his surface, achieving a sensual effect that &quot;looked like corduroy, felt like corduroy, and was seductive.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Gehry researched the material, and devised a construction method and an efficient dye-cutting manufacturing system that allowed him to create regular or eccentric shapes and ribbon-like forms as seen in the compressed curves of the &quot;Wiggle&quot; stool. The furniture could be produced quickly and sold at low prices.\nThis stool relates to a lounge chair, 1988-79-2, and side chair, 1988-79-1, in the collection, but they are more conventional looking seating forms than the stool, with its whiplash curves. The three pieces together provide a good range of forms that could be achieved in the &quot;Easy Edges&quot; series.",
