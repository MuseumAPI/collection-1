An allover scroll design of Chinese leaves and flowers fills the large and one of the small radiating panels, the panel at left in solid color. The oval center filled with a single flower. There is a mannered juxtaposition of a Venetian red line with blue infill of a star shape. This is also seen in the surrounding pointed windows.\n\nOriginal album associated with this collection still exists.  See 1948-40-1 accessory",
