    "description":"This view of a salon in Vienna is dominated by an ogee-patterned carpet in blue and red. The blue spoon-back chairs are upholstered in blue velvet with red and blue fringe at bottom. Black and gold japanned cabinets, whatnots and famille noire porcelain vases decorate the room. A Rococo Style console in white and gold and a gilt mirror flanked by candelabra are placed between the windows. The Louis XV-inspired chandelier may have been from the Baccarat factory. Thonet bentwood chairs with cane seats are casually placed around the room.",
