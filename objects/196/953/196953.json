  "description": "The design features a vertical view of a fork shape, formed by type, placed to the right of center in the left hand column, which comprises one-third of the page width. The viewer turns the page to a horizontal position to read the contents. Restaurant Bellevues, in heavy black sans serif type, gradually diminishing in size, begins near the bottom edge of the page and extends upward about two thirds of the length, forming the handle of the fork. The address, in one line of concave type forming the base of the tines, appears just above the s in Bellevues; the telephone number, imprinted upside down, follows above on one horizontal line. The tines are formed by four lines of serif style type, more widely spaced at the base than at the edge; the copy cites the restaurant's special services.",
