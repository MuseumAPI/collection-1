    "description": "formed of a series of S-curves in ormolu, surrounding a grille on the top with curvy scroll decoration, the front and back of different scroll forms, the front with central asymmetrical shell",
    "justification": "This musical clock stand&amp;nbsp;represents the epitome of French mid-eighteenth century rococo design.&amp;nbsp; Ormolu, a process of molding and gilding bronze, was created by specialists. Occasionally, furniture makers did work in ormolu to make the mounts for their furniture. However, they&amp;nbsp;could be&amp;nbsp;taken to court for going outside their guilds if they did so. A few furniture makers with&amp;nbsp;royal appointments such as Andr\u00e9-Charles&amp;nbsp;Boulle and&amp;nbsp; Charles Cressent,&amp;nbsp; the latter active&amp;nbsp;at the time this stand was made, were exempt from this rule, and could provide their own ormolu.&amp;nbsp;Before&amp;nbsp;electricity and gas lighting, candlelight would have been used as&amp;nbsp;the sole source of light&amp;nbsp;in the interiors in which this clock was intended to go.&amp;nbsp; As many surfaces and forms as possible would have been augmented with metalwork, either silver, or gilded bronze for the wealthy, to create additional reflection to give light and glamour to an interior. The quality of the form and the skill in linear detailing were key to the total effect of an object and perceived to be important in highlighting the quality of the object that was associated with a piece of ormolu.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the musical clock would have almost certainly been by a top clock maker.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nThis piece is far more than simply an accessory to a clock. It is a great example of style and form in its own right.&amp;nbsp; It not only exemplifies the organic, asymmetrical sinuous lines of rococo design, but the crisp and clear detailing of the chasing shows great skill of execution. The dating of this piece is known due to the presence of a tax stamp on one foot -a crowned &quot;C&quot; that indicates it was made between 1745-1749 when that stamp was in use.&amp;nbsp; The scrolls, different on front and back, support a stand, with open pierced metal scrolls, a decorative design that would let the sound of the music out, but not be seen, as the clock would have fit on top of it.&amp;nbsp; This attention to unseen detail was a sign of the craftsman's interest in presenting a coherent design in its own right without the object it was to support.&amp;nbsp; This stand most likely&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;have held the music box for the musical component of the clock. The clock feet would have fit into&amp;nbsp;the shaped cartouche holding the pierced portion.\nMetalwork is a major&amp;nbsp;part of Cooper Hewitt's collection,&amp;nbsp;including many ormolu and gilt-metal mounts but with the exception of a rococo lock and lockplate, this would&amp;nbsp;represent the Collection's&amp;nbsp;first significant object &amp;nbsp;of French rococo ormolu &amp;nbsp;from the eighteenth century, acknowledging &amp;nbsp;its key role in the history of design.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n",
