    "gallery_text": "Deskey was one of the leading American industrial designers of the 20th century. His work was strongly influenced by the European Art deco movement, especially after visiting the Paris World Fair of 1925. It was upon returning to America after this event that he became a designer, seeking to bring home some of the innovations he had observed. He is best known for his modernist and streamlined approach to the interiors of Radio City Hall, commissioned in 1930 by John D. Rockefeller, and for his packaging designs which shaped the appearance of American everyday objects from the 1940\u2019s onwards. This greeting card illustrates his purist approach to Art deco, reducing a leaf motif to abstraction. Stylized ovals, straight lines and triangles soberly imitate vegetation in shades of black, grey and white. The diagonals produced by the design cut off the edges of the image, suggesting a larger, broader scale.",
    "label_text": "Industrial designer Deskey is best remembered for his innovative packaging design and projects such as the dramatic interiors of Radio City Music Hall. But he also had a keen eye for pattern, as the stylized black and gray leaves and intersecting triangles of this drawing for a greeting card suggest.",
