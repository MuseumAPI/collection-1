    "justification": "\nThe Praxis GRIP flashlight, designed by Alexander Taylor, was released in September, 2012, and made its debut in a bold red version at the Conran\u2019s Shop\u2019s &quot;RED&quot; 25th-Anniversary celebration during the London Design Festival. Taylor designed this LED flashlight in response to the rubber material brief of the first Praxis collection. The GRIP flashlight utilizes silicone rubber, which has many advantages over conventional plant-based rubber: silicone rubber is resistant to extreme temperatures, has excellent tensile and tear strength, and is inert, so does not react with most chemicals and other materials, hence its use in many food preparation and medical applications, and for medical implants. \u2026[T]he very nature of the material,\u2026 provides a practical, simple, tactile solution to the project.&quot; \nTaylor employs&amp;nbsp;a considered and&amp;nbsp;intelligent approach to design. For this utilitarian flashlight, he drew inspiration from the form of a simple cylindrical BMX (motocross) bicycle handlebar grip. &amp;nbsp;The flashlight\u2019s textured&amp;nbsp;soft rubber handle is comfortable to grasp and hold, the narrow cylindrical form leading directly to a broad conical rubber head that surrounds a bright central LED light source behind a small lens. In addition to protecting the lens, the soft rubber head acts like a suction cup and can stick to any horizontal or vertical surface. The light is turned on and off via a push-button in the flat end of the handle. In addition to red, Praxis produces the GRIP in four bright colors\u2014blue, yellow, black, and white\u2014making it easy to find in any setting.",
