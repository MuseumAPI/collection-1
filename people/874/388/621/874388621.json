    "biography": "Draft #1 Friedrich Becker, whose background was in aeronautical engineering, was a goldsmith with a mind for invention and a drive for changing the definition of jewelry in the second half of the twentieth century. Credited as the creator of kinetic jewelry, Becker devised pieces that were not only made for viewing but that required personal interaction between the piece and its wearer. Defying the laws of physics, geometric, minimalist gemstones magically move on their settings as if caught in a dance, letting the movement of the hand direct the piece. Along with his work in jewelry, Becker was a professor at the D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s Arts and Crafts School, now known as the University of Applied Sciences.",
