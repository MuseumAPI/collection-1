  "description": "Sampler embroidered in blues, greens and yellows on a loosely woven natural linen ground. In the center, a large urn of flowers rests on a grassy mound, with a female figure standing on either side. Spot motifs of birds, baskets of fruit, and flowering trees fill the field. The inscription is framed in a vine at the top, followed by a verse:\r\nCould I by bearing Mary's name like her be wise in heart \r\nAll worldly cares would disclaim and choose her better part\r\n",
