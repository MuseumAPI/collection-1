    "justification": "From the Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Context: In 1998 after one year of fine arts Joris Laarman started his study at the Design Academy Eindhoven, graduating in 2003.&amp;nbsp; He gained notice with his functional, decorative radiator Heatwave, which has been acquired by international museums and has won several awards. That same year he started his own independent firm, Joris Laarman Studio, which focuses on product design and architecture, often combining a conceptual and poetic approach with style and engineering. In addition to the studio's highly unique editions, Laarman has also created works for several well known international industrial design companies such as Droog, Flos, Artecnica, and Swarovski. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe Radiator: Joris Laarman's Heatwave radiator is an exuberant combination of decorative form and functionality.&amp;nbsp; Laarman describes his inspiration as: &quot;In a time of arbitrariness and opportunism I am searching for ornamental but somehow necessary form. Modernistic functionality and post modernistic effusiveness do not have to exclude each other. I wanted to demonstrate that functionalists are also sinners of styling, and that soberness is not always more functional than highly decorative form. A radiator needs a surface as large as possible to lose its heat radiation. Ornamental and highly decorative form has a surface that is larger than sober conventional radiators. Using this aspect I designed a decorative radiator that is functioning better or as good as a normal heating.&quot;&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
