  "description": "Architectural fantasy.  A number of architectural elements scattered across a hilly landscape.  In the foreground, at left, is a large scale tomb.  A female figure stands in front of the entrance.  Next to the altar, at the center, is a pedestal with a statue of Sphinx.  Behind it, is an obelisk.  To the right of the pedestal, in the foreground, is a semi-circular structure, possibly a fountain.  There are figures sitting on top of it.  In the far distance, at different elevations, are ruins of classical temples.  Tree trunks and tree branches partially cover the structures, esp. towards the edges of the image.",
