    "justification":"Piazza Prints opened in 1946 as an independent hand screen-printer in New York. The company produced a number of entertaining designs by Saul Steinberg (1914- 1999) as wallcoverings, textiles and scarves. The Romanian-born Steinberg studied architecture in Milan beginning in 1933, but soon after began publishing cartoons. By the time he graduated in 1940, his drawings were appearing in Life and Harper's Bazaar. In 1941, anti-Jewish laws in Fascist Italy forced him to emigrate to the United States. He began publishing regularly in The New Yorker, a relationship that lasted almost sixty years and produced ninety covers and over a thousand drawings and cartoons. Steinberg was an Artist in Residence at the Smithsonian in 1967, ane is well represented in the Smithsonian collections, with at least forty works in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Cooper-Hewitt has examples in the Drawings, Prints and Graphic Design; Wallcoverings, and Textiles departments.",
