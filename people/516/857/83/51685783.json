    "biography":"Named after the city in which it was founded, The Buffalo Pottery Company began as a division of the  Larkin Soap Company, which was housed in a building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  The Larkin Soap Company needed  to boost soap sales in 1901, so the company put certificates  on soap packages good for soap dishes in return for the coupons.  It succeeded mainly because of the design and quality of the pottery\n Ceramics engineer William Rea, who created the dish model, continued with a line of ceramics including an olive green mix that produced  gradations of color in the finished product, unlike existing pottery. As the soap dish giveaway slowed, in 1903 the Buffalo Pottery Company became the sole distributor of this pottery dubbed Deldare Ware. The Buffalo Pottery Company expanded to include other china related products.  Buffalo launched a commercial business in 1914 by making some of the first vitrified china on the market, created specifically for hotel dining rooms and restaurants.\n The Buffalo Pottery Company is still in business today and it is operating as a division of Oneida, Ltd.",
