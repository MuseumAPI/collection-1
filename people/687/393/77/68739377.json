    "biography": "LUNATIK is a start-up venture and brand founded by product designer Scott Wilson, in conjunction with his design studio, MNML, in 2010. The idea for LUNATIK began with Wilson's concept for a watchband that helped to convert a 6th generation iPod Nano into a wearable wristwatch. In addition to selling models of the TikTok and LunaTik watches, LUNATIK has expanded its small but growing firm to include various styluses for tablet devices, TacTik iPhone protection systems, as well as other designs for linked watchbands.",
