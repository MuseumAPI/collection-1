    "description": "Vertical rectangle. Design for a reliquary, the pedestal in the shape of an antae sarcophagus, featuring a pelican on clouds and cherubim supports. Above, a serpent coils around the base of the cross with an apple in its mouth. Above, the Veil of Veronica hangs with the image of the face of Jesus Christ. Spear and sponge staff are carried in front of the bottom part of the cross above the cloth, the sudarium suspended from them. Four circular receptacles, inscribed \"Relliquia\" are proposed, three of them at the ends of the cross arms, the fourth between the tops of the spear and the staff. A small cross-shaped receptacle is in the center. The nails, dice, hammer, and tongs surround its top. A crown supported by two flying putti at the top of the reliquary.",
