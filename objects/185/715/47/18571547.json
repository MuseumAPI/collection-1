Their intended purpose is unknown, but they may have served as patterns for embroidery or textiles, or as a demonstration of the artist\u2019s craftsmanship. D\u00fcrer studied geometry, a subject on which he would write several books, which could explain his interest for these intricate designs. This particular one includes a blank amazon shield in its center, set out against a black background and held up by the ropes which form the overall pattern. Some art historians believe these knots could be a form of spiritual exploration, representing D\u00fcrer\u2019s vision of the Christian cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth.",
