    "biography": "Emeco was founded in 1940 by Wilton Carlyle Dinges, in Hanover, PA. Emeco stands for Electrical Machine and Equipment Company. The company's first products drew on the ability of local craftsmen and used scrap aluminum to create chairs, tables, and lockers for the American government. Emeco is most famous for their collaboration with Alcoa experts on the 1006 Navy Chair made of recycled aluminum that has been used on Navy submarines since 1944. The Navy Chair was so dirable that it had an estimated life cycle of 150 years and far exceeded the Navy's expectations. In 1998, Greg Buchbinder purchased Emeco and repositioned the company, making chairs for and by architects and designers. The current goal of the company is to make items that last long enough that recycling becomes obsolete. Their products are made to be timeless, simple, comfortable, and strong, and use carefully chosen materials. In order to make products that fit these ideals, Emeco handcrafts items that will last generations, which is how they define \u201csustainability.\u201d The company explores ways to use consumer and industrial waste in addition to environmentally responsible resources to use in their products.",
