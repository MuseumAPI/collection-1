    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;The New England Glass company was located in East Cambridge, MA from about 1818 until 1888. Like the Boston and Sandwich company, a strike forced its closing in 1888. However, rather than go out of business, the company\u2019s owner, Edward D. Libbey, moved&amp;nbsp; the factory to Toledo, Ohio, where it still exists as the Libbey-Owens-Ford Company. The New England Glass Company made a large variety of glasswares, from pocket bottles and tumblers to art glass, using a range of techniques including molding, mechanical pressing, cutting, and engraving. It produced some of the finest blown glass in the United States, competitive with European examples. The glass had a high lead content, simple outlines, and was carefully finished.&amp;nbsp; The firm was also famous for its rich colors, especially&amp;nbsp; ruby red and the amberina range, a blended colored glass in which the lower part, a yellowish amber, merges into a ruby-red color higher up such as in this vase. \n&amp;nbsp;An example of American technological innovation, the amberina technique was patented in 1883 by New England, and produced extensively there as well as by the successor company, the Libbey Glass Company into the 1890s. The base metal was an amber glass containing some gold, and the tinges were developed by applied reheating. The glass was sometimes blown in molds,although this example appears to be hand-blown.&quot;",
