  "description": "Dominating the wall elevation in the center of this view is a large Flemish tapestry showing a classical temple on the left, trees in the background, and barely visible figures in the foreground. A seventeenth century Flemish cabinet-on-stand holding a display of Chinese porcelains is flanked by settees upholstered in burgundy velvet. The ceiling border is stuccoed in a classical mask and swag design. A porphyry column on the right delineates a curtained doorway. The overdoor broken pediment and urn decorations on the left follow the classical vocabulary of this elevation.",
