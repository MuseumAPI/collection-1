    "description":"Sectional elevation (above) and plan (below) for a twenty step 'English Style' spiral staircase. Starts as a single flight, and then splits into two curved sections before rejoining to form a single flight at the top.  Numbered annotations on each step.",
    "justification":"This well-executed drawing appears to correspond directly to one of the staircase models given to Cooper-Hewitt by Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw.&amp;nbsp; The drawing, which&amp;nbsp;shows both an elevation and a cross-section of the staircase's revolutions, represents an example of the compagnonnage training in design at a considerably earlier date than the other staircase drawings in Cooper-Hewitt's collection.&amp;nbsp; With a date of 1836, the drawing demonstrates the continuum of this system of design training and of the forms taught.&amp;nbsp; The inscription on the drawing also suggests that it was executed in Paris, which indicates that the work was probably completed to show design mastery in the journeyman phase.",
