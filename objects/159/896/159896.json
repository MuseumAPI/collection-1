  "description": "Poster for a 1966 concert featuring Jefferson Airplane, Muddy Waters, Butterfield Blues Band, 9/23-10/2, at Fillmore & Winterland, organized by infamous rock impressario, Bill Graham.  A dancing nude woman is underneath with words \"The Sound\" outlined in purple. The poster relates more directly to Graham, who is credited with coining the phrase, \"The San Francisco Sound,\" which immediately became known as \"The Sound.\" The vibrant colors take precedent over the content of the lettering and background. \r\n",
