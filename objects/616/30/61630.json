  "description": "Vertical rectangle. The mensa is in the center of the socle zone; beside it are two panels with escutcheons. Laterally stand rectangular pedestals, either of them with a medallion above crossed branches at the front, and with a group of standing figures between two sitting angels. In the next zone are three projecting pedestals. The outer ones, with a representation at their fronts, support two columns each; the central one, decorated with a festoon, supports a group, consisting of a woman with a cross, and angels. The retable forms a niche, the conch of which his above the entablature. On top is a triangular pediment, with two figures standing upon the lower corners, and on top the triangle in a globe, with a glory of rays, supported apparently by two sitting angels.",
