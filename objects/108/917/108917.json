  "description": "Hand-woven sample for drapery material in a checkerboard of horizontal rectangles of orange and grey-green with an overall vertical stripe effect.  Double cloth type bound in plain weave. The warp is of white cotton used in pairs, bound with single wefts of orange boucle yarn or paired wefts of one gray-green cotton with one gold metallic thread.  The lighter bands are double cloth with a pocketed structure; in the darker bands the two layers are locked together in a taquete structure. The vertical stripe effect is caused by the exchange of wefts from one face to the other.",
