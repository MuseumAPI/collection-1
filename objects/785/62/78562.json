In the center is an elaborately pierced iron lamp, like a basket, suspended from two chains made of s-shaped links that hang from a delicate leafy bracket.  Above is a pilaster drawn so that its orientation on the page is horizontal.  It is rendered in graphite without any wash, perhaps to indicate the material was marble.  The pilaster has a panel of vase-like and leafy ornament, with an elaborate capital above.",
