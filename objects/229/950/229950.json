  "description": "This opulent salon is dominated by ormolu-mounted furniture in the Boulle style and blue velvet upholstered sofas and chairs from the Rococo Revival period. The grand candelabra, center chandelier and lamps are contemporaneous with the period. The chimneypiece and overmantel mirror are in the Louis XV taste. Imposing classical columns, sculpture, paintings and porcelain create a room that is a testament to wealth and display.",
