  "description": "The present photograph features a rectangular object, fabricated of metal, with rounded corners on the upper edges. The shiny, unadorned surface is interrupted on the two narrow ends by a stepped design, which begins on the top and segues into a center section of vertical ribbing, visible on the side panel in the photograph (and, it is assumed, duplicated on the other, non-visible side.) A narrow metal stem with a rectangular terminal, perhaps fabricated of black Bakelite, protrudes on the right end. The object is possibly a heater, intended to rest on the floor; or a tabletop object, such as an unfinished prototype of a toaster or radio cabinet.",
