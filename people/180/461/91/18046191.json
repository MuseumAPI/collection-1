    "biography": "Albert John Pucci (American, 1920-2005) was known for painting street scenes in a realist style that was sometimes described as romantic cubism. When he was three years old, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he lived in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood for the next 80 years. He studied at the Brooklyn Academy of Fine Arts and then attended Pratt Institute, where he later taught figure drawing and layout and design for 24 years.\nIn 1954, Associated American Artists (AAA) mounted Pucci\u2019s first solo show. Pucci also sold textile designs through AAA in the early 1950s.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Pucci was a prolific book cover artist. Dell, Signet, Washington Square Press, Mentor Books, and Houghton Mifflin commissioned him to illustrate new editions of classic literature, including titles by Charlotte Bronte, Shakespeare, and Mark Twain. \nPucci\u2019s work has been exhibited at the National Academy in New York and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Thayer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas, and the Wausau Museum in Wausau, Wisconsin; and in the corporate collections of Abbot Laboratories, Pfizer, Sears Roebuck, Lehman Brothers, MetLife, Montgomery Ward, and Nabisco.\nThere are currently two examples of Pucci's work in the museum's collection: Textile, Duck Blind, 1953 (1994-38-11) and Textile, Harvest, 1955 (1994-38-9).",
