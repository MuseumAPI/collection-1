    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;American glass is one of the earliest industries in which American originality shows up in commercially-produced objects.&amp;nbsp; Not only was pressed glass first developed in this country by either the New England or the Boston and Sandwich (MA) Glass company (ca 1825-27), but other techniques, especially those associated with mass production and the use and development of certain colors, found favor in the United States. This was in contrast to the porcelain industry which was more heavily reliant upon imports from England and France.&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;The New England Glass Company of East Cambridge, MA and the Boston and Sandwich&amp;nbsp; Glass Company, located in Sandwich, MA were two of the top producers of high quality glass that used innovative techniques from this period. Deming Jarvis started the latter in 1825 in Sandwich, a small town on Cape Cod that was rich in fuel, had easy access to major waterways, and was located only 50 miles from Boston. Boats could dock at the plant making for easy transport of goods. Although on the Cape, Sandwich lacked fine sand, so sand was brought in from New Jersey and Western Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This pitcher is a fine example of the explosion of interest in crackle glass in the nineteenth century. While the precise origins of this technique are unknown, Venetian glassmakers of the sixteenth century claim credit for similar work produced by plunging red-hot glass into cold water, then reheating and reblowing it.&amp;nbsp; Patents were issued in both the US and England in the late 1870's and 80's. The process, known as &quot; ice glass &quot; or &quot;overshot&quot; as created in Sandwich, was so popular that both during their production and after it was imitated.&quot;",
