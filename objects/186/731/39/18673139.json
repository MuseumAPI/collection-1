    "description": "Design for stock certificate broken into roughly four distinct areas. On upper left is a long, vertical box infilled with a blue security pattern. Written in upper left: Certificate For Not More Than 100,000 Shares. About half way down section is white box for certificate number. On the right side of document is another, smaller blue box with same phrase and white box for number of shares. Filling up a little more than a fourth of the document is a light blue box extending from upper right corner. Within this section is stock certificate information, the Citicorp logotype and logo, and, further down, space to signify certificate owner. Below blue box is a paragraph in script discussing validity of certificate in front of the text: Certificate of Stock, rendered in light blue. Running along entire bottom of certificate are signatures from authorized officers, secretary, and chairman. About a third of height down and a fifth of width across, an etching of Hermes is depicted. He is loosely clothed and holds a caduceus and winged wheel. On right side of document, a vertical box running length of page is filled with blue security pattern.",
