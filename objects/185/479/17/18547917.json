A foliated, scalloped and fluted balustrade supporting the bowl with the socket from the top part. At center, the shafts consisting of seated griffins, worked \u00e0 jour, connected by festoons and flanking a papal escutcheon. On them stands a base upon which the animals of the Evangelists support the sphere upon which are shown the allegorical figures of Justice or Strength, Faith, and Love. A calyx rises over them, supporting the bowl and socket. At right, a calyx supports a baluster, the bottom part of which is covered by a calyx, from which vine stem rises. The top is similar to other designs. A scale at bottom. Two framing lines at bottom, partly cut off.",
