  "description": "Horizontal sheet tipped vertically into binding.  In the center of the midground, a mill is seen from the front at a distance in a marshy landscape.  The view of the artist is from across a body of water where marsh grasses are indicated, and the water deep enough for two small boats to navigate it.  The mast and sails of two boats are visible at left and right of the mill, further obscured by the grasses in the foreground.",
