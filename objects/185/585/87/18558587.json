    "description": "A dado is shown at the bottom, an entablature, the bottom molding of which colored green, is on the top. The decoration consists of broad plant motifs alternating with narrow floral stripes. The background is divided into narrow green stripes behind the central parts of the plant motifs, and into broad rose stripes. Two plant motifs are suggested alternatively waved stems with petals and leaves, and leaf boughs; for the stripes are suggested rows of leaves with seeds or vine leaves on a straight stem. A row of petals, which are connected by palm leaves, is laid upon the tops of the stripes.",
