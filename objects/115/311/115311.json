  "description": "The dark outline describes a full, somewhat square face, with defined cheekbones and a rounded chin. Under gently curved eyebrows, the eyes, indicated by straight lines within their sockets, glance slightly upward and to the left. The columnar nose ends in a sharp vertical line indicating the nostrils. The upper lip, bow-shaped, is closed over the lower, full one. Strands of wavy hair frame the face from eye level to just above shoulder level. An outline framing the head around the top and on the outer side of the hair strands suggests a headdress; vertical strokes on the forehead are either part of the headdress design or may be additional hair.  A scalloped curve below the neck represents either a collar or necklace.",
