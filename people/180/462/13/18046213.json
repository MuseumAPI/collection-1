    "biography": "Tony Sarg was a popular illustrator, children\u2019s book author, designer, animator, and puppeteer in the 1920s and 30s. His father was an artist, his grandfather a wood carver, and his grandmother a collector of marionettes and toys, which may have contributed to his capacious imagination and lifelong fascination with creating enchantments for children.   \n After a brief military career, Sarg first turned his abundant drawing skills to a career in advertising in London, where he created a memorable series of posters for the London Underground. At the outset of World War I, he and his wife and daughter moved to New York.  He began working as an illustrator for the New York Times, the Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, Cosmopolitan, Boy\u2019s Life, Vanity Fair, and other leading magazines. \nFrom the 1920s on, he also created elaborate window displays for Macy\u2019s, and was the artistic director of the Macy\u2019s Christmas Parade (now called the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade), which culminated in front of the store with the unveiling of the holiday windows. In 1927, he introduced the oversized inflated balloon characters which have become the hallmark of the parade, and in the 1930s created Macy\u2019s first animatronic Christmas window displays. \nSarg also had successful marionette theaters in New York and Chicago, which toured shows around the country and inspired a new generation of puppeteers, including Bill Baird and Margo and Rufus Rose, the creators of Howdy Doody. He also created over twenty animated films. \nHis intricate and humorous drawings were beloved by children, and in addition to authoring numerous children\u2019s books, he also designed children\u2019s barber shops and toy departments for department stores, as well as a variety of children\u2019s products, such as textiles, wallpapers, and furniture, which he retailed through his own children\u2019s shops in New York and Nantucket. \nSarg died in 1942 from complications after an appendectomy.",
