    "justification": "This poster, one of a series of eight designed by Mark Gowing for a personal project, was inspired by Gowing\u2019s concerned observation that \u201c[o]ur contemporary world seems to be in a constantly heightening state of panic over people\u2019s origins and intents.&amp;nbsp; Judging individuals on face value seems to be an increasing concern at both a social and political level as the global melting pot takes a firm step backwards.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Gowing created this set of posters to highlight what he feels is the \u201cunjust nature of labelling an individual based on their appearance.\u201d&amp;nbsp; Gowing sourced his images from an inexpensive, royalty free image bank and printed them at large scale in black and white using a laser plotter printer.&amp;nbsp; He purchased off-the-shelf stickers which he then applied by hand to the surface of the poster, creating the \u201clabels\u201d, such as \u201chomeless,\u201d \u201creligious,\u201d and \u201cindigenous.\u201d&amp;nbsp; For this poster, Gowing use red stickers printed with white letters featuring the word \u201cSOLD\u201d to form the word \u201crefugee\u201d across the face of a man in glasses.&amp;nbsp; ",
