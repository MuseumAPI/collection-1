They support with their heads flower pots from which candelabra rise, with winged half-figures on top supporting with their raised hands a garland and festoons. Three women, embracing each other, stand upon the pedestal. The two lateral ones support with their arms the squrae frame of a landscape. Above it is a floral candelabrum with two half figures. Below, at the front of the pedestal, sits a putto, his hands resting upon two festoons.",
