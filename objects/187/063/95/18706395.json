    "justification":"From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;This is a fine example of streamlined furniture belonging to the thirties with a different aesthetic from the sometime silver and gold-leaf decoration of Frankl's early work.\nTrained as an architect in Germany and Austria, Frankl came to the U.S. in 1914, designing several interiors for Helena Rubenstein and stage sets for the Theater Guild in New York in 1915-16.&amp;nbsp; He worked mainly as a decorator, but as early as 1925, he began designing geometric cabinetwork and other furniture with flat surfaces, sharp angles and stepped forms, which he dubbed Skyscraper furniture, reminiscent of this new architectural form beginning to dominate the New York skyline.&amp;nbsp; Frankl sold his designs in his midtown gallery and participated in the first Art in Trade exhibition at Macy\u2019s in 1927. These exhibitions at Macy\u2019s were a major force in the shaping of taste in that era,&amp;nbsp; including being one of the primary means of exposing Americans to the new Art Deco style seen in 1925 at the Exposition des arts d\u00e9coratifs in Paris. In contrast, Frankl was among the first progressive designers in America to create new forms inspired by the American scene, and was an influential advocate of modern design which he promoted in two books, New Dimensions: the Decorative Arts of Today, and, Form and Re-Form, published in 1928 and 1930, respectively.&quot;",
