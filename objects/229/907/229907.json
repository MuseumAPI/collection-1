Sienna-colored tieback curtains coordinate with the tones of the upholstered Empire style furniture. Console tables on either side of the room are placed in front of tall mirrors which reflect gilt-bronze candelabra. Blue painted medallions in the Empire style decorate the upper border of the salon.",
