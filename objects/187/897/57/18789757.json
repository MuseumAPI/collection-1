    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Founded with the aim of helping tenants who were victims of the potato famine, The Belleek Pottery Works was established in 1857 in Northern Ireland by John Caldwell Bloomfield who owned the nearby Castlecaldwell estate, which included the village of Belleek, and two partners. One of these, Robert Williams Armstrong was an architect from London, with an interest in ceramics. The other was David McBirney, a wealthy merchant from Dublin.\nBloomfield was an amateur mineralogist who ordered a geological survey of his land.&amp;nbsp; When he discovered the raw materials for ceramics, Feldspar, kaolin, flint, clay and shale, he saw the potential and persuaded the Railway Service to come to Belleek to bring in coal, and transport Belleek\u2019s products to market. Initially, he exported the raw materials to England as well.\n&amp;nbsp;\nEarly production centered on high quality domestic ware from mortars and pestles to washstands, tableware, and telegraph insulators. He found apprentices locally, but recruited 14 craftsmen from Stoke-on-Trent, home to numerous ceramics companies. From the beginning, the partners from England felt that the craftsmanship should be fully utilized for artistic creations. This aim was greatly aided by the development in 1863 of a type of porcelain that the firm called Parian. As exemplified by this fruit basket, the porcelain was worked with increasing finesse and the firm developed a unique, slightly iridescent high lustre. \n&amp;nbsp;\nAs early as 1865, the firm was exporting not only to England but also to the United States, Canada, and Australia. Queen Victoria ordered Parianware as well. Belleek exhibited in this country in the 1870's and was a strong influence on American ceramicists. In 1893, Frederick Slater, a master craftsman who moved from England to Belleek, created a centerpiece that won a Gold Medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1900.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis basket has references to both eighteenth-century rococo work by firms such as Meissen and Chelsea, and an Art Nouveau sensibility that is enhanced by the iridescence of the glaze.&amp;nbsp; What is extraordinary is the detail and ultra-thin elements that are finely modeled and put together with artistic tendrils and other naturalistic devices. This bowls is a major treasure to be used as a centerpiece or table decoration as well as a possible fruit basket. It provides technical as well as social commentary on the inventiveness of its era.&quot;",
