  "description": "The south facade of the Carnegie Mansion is embellished in color, transforming the building into a summer villa. Additions to the original photomechanical elevation include wrought iron railings and a stripped awning at right just off the area occupied by the conservatory and picture gallery. Large white clouds billow up into a blue sky behind the mansion. Small figures enliven the scene: at left, lovers seem to dance under the tree; above them a figure on a balcony eavesdrops. Others appear in the windows or stand waiting at the door.",
