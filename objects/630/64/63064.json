  "description": "The structures project from what evidently is the choir of a church, the choir being three sides of an octagon as a plan.  The plans of each structure are halves of hexagons.  The elevations show sockles, orders of imbedded Doric columns containing niches and being triangular pediments, balustrades from which obelisks rise in the lateral structure, upon which statues stand, in the center.  Segments of lanterns and domes form the top parts, the central one being much higher and more elaborate than the lateral ones.",
