    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;With solutions to the world\u2019s environmental problems of ever increasing concern, the development of low-energy lighting technologies has been a burgeoning area of contemporary design and manufacture. The low energy CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) light bulb is rooted in 19th-century technology, but has come to the forefront of energy saving devices, available to large numbers of consumers at a relatively low coast for about the last five years. Compared to incandescent lamps giving the same amount of light, CFLs use about 80% less power and last about eight times longer. The now familiar bulbs with straight- or spiral-form CFL tubes are widely available, but are considered as purely utilitarian objects--a light source devoid of aesthetic qualities. \n&amp;nbsp;\nIn 2007, the English telecommunications firm Hulger ventured into lighting design with the Plumen (the word derived from the word plumage) project, geared toward designing a more attractive and interesting bulb shape using only the form of the CFL tubes themselves. The result is the \u201cPlumen 001\u201d low energy light bulb. The young English designer Samuel Wilkinson worked with Hulger to devise an organic, linear silhouette formed by two long, looping CFL tubes meant to be exposed, not hidden within a fixture or under a lamp shade. The curved shape of the tubes \u201c\u2026[reference] the filaments of an incandescent bulb\u2026\u201d and are intended to make the bulb itself attractive to the consumer. The bulb can be used in any socket made for an incandescent bulb, whether hanging, wall-mounted, or in a table lamp.&quot;\n&amp;nbsp;",
