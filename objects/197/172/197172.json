  "description": "In a black and white photographic reproduction, fourteen men and women are posed in one row against an allover pattern of miniscule Christmas trees, represented in outline form by triangles atop vertical lines. The models, all facing the viewer, stand with their feet placed on the same level; however, since their heights vary, an imaginary line drawn across through the tops of their heads would assume a zigzag form.  Their poses, facial expressions and clothing styles vary: some men are dressed in suits and ties, some in informal wear; the women all wear dresses or skirts and tops.",
