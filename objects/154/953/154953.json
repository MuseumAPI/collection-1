  "description": "Unfinished double page.  The first page, on the left, has an orangish red \"C\" with black and white flowers behind it.  Beside this a paragraph of text that reads: \"C'etais ce jour fameux ou le soleil voile *ja dis sembla* pleurer sur la mort de son maitre; oui, c'etait ce jour-la que mon coeur fut vole, ma dame, et que voire oeil fit l'office du traitre.\"  Above this text are buildings and below it is a window box filled with colorful fruits.  On the opposite page, possibly the title page, is written: \"Petraque: SONNETS\"  Below this it gives Alexandra Exter as the illustrator and that the manuscript is by Gio Colucci.  La Trireme is the publisher.  Below this is a ship (presumably a trireme) at sea with a six-pointed star on it, oars coming from its sides, and a G and C on either side of it.\r\nVerso: Illustration of orange and magenta carnation with vase, bowl, and an electric yellow and gray butterfly.  Around this image, it reads: \"Laura Petrarca Noves.\r\n\r\n",
