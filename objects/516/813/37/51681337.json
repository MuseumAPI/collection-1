    "description": "The undulating single panel seat starting from a back-curved head rest and descending on an angled plane to the bottom of spine before heading up to bend at the knee area and descending slightly at calf length, all supported between two curvilinear arms, descending to a cross bar and continuing to form back legs, connecting at the cross brace to seat supports of trapezoidal shape.",
    "justification": "This chair is significant in the history of twentieth century design in so many ways. It represents another step in the history of bentwood furniture, a subject that evolves from the early nineteenth century to the present day. It also represents the evolution of a major designer: Marcel Breuer, and his collaboration with other designers.\nThis chair represents the transformation and adaptation&amp;nbsp;of a design from one medium to another.&amp;nbsp; The first iteration of the bent form lounge chair by Breuer was a frame for a reclining chair in aluminum and steel with wood arm rests.&amp;nbsp; The chair's design is a derivation of a Breuer aluminium chair of 1932-33, whose design followed his innovative Bauhaus designs in chrome-plated metal, such as the B2 and the B5 chairs, (both in CHNDM\u2019s collection) of the 1920\u2019s.&amp;nbsp; This long chair was his first assay into bentwood and the first chair produced by the newly formed British-based Isokon Furniture Company, founded by Jack Pritchard after discussions with Walter Gropius, which grew out of the principles of the Isokon Company.&amp;nbsp; Pritchard helped convince Breuer to&amp;nbsp;move to England, and his commitment to plywood as a medium for furniture ensured the firm\u2019s direction. Although the chair's design derives from a Breuer's earlier work, the use of plywood is influenced by the moulded furniture of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. \nChristopher Wilk in his important book for the MoMA 1981 exhibition, Marcel Breuer: Furniture and Interiors, cites a memorandum that both indicates the firm\u2019s desire to combine high price market modern furniture to attract the design savvy in England, using variety and individuality in each object to create a taste for mass market production ultimately. The material to do this was plywood. In his \u201cDraft History\u201d (Pritchard Archive), Pritchard explains:The principal material to be used in the preliminary work must be plywood\u2026\nMetal may be incorporated just where it performs a function better than plywood\u2026\nThe furniture will be primarily useful and its aesthetic qualities will be due to its form rather than superimposed ornament\u2026\nIn chairs, comfort will be the objective. Much recent modern furniture has failed to give the traditional English comfort though its form and shape has been pleasing\u2026\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe use of wood, warmer in color and touch and not as austere as tubular metal, along with an interest in comfort, would be the means to attract an English audience toward \u201cModern\u201d style in an era when a return to the eighteenth century and plush interiors were the norm. \nHence the decision to have Breuer design a comfortable reclining armchair: the idea did not come from Breuer but from Walter Gropius. It was Pritchard who suggested he start by basing a plywood chair on his aluminum version. The result was the first Isokon chair design in December 1935.\nAlthough it incorporates&amp;nbsp;a modification with&amp;nbsp;a cross bar for greater stability, added in 1936, this version must be&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;early production since the plywood portion is marked with a stamp \u201cMade in Estonia\u201d.&amp;nbsp; The Venesta Plywood company's factories in Estonia made first prototypes of the seats for the long chair. These seats were sent to London and combined by Harry Mansell, a furniture maker who worked with Breuer, Gropius, and Pritchard in a workshop where he made the frame in his own wooden forms, and then assembled with the seat sent pre-bent from Estonia.&amp;nbsp; As this was only the case during the pre-World War II production phase, the Estonia mark indicates this is an early production piece. Only a few were made, because the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 put an end to Isokon's manufacturing.\nMost of the translation from aluminum to plywood worked, but in the attempt not to use metal, there was less stability to these chairs with lateral movement, and Breuer's realization that&amp;nbsp;he needed to add a strip to give the arm additional support was the first adjustment. Numerous subsequent&amp;nbsp;variations exist, including a shorter version, various upholstered versions, a development from this early&amp;nbsp;this early model, which cost over \u00a36&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;would have been used with a cushion, made to order in England.&amp;nbsp; However, in this example, without a cushion, &amp;nbsp;the really organic nature and warm color&amp;nbsp;of the wood shine through&amp;nbsp;along with the sinuous lines of this chair.",
