  "description": "The print depicts the light well at the building's inner core. The main features of the light well are the skylight (upper center), the ramp (lower left), and the staircase (upper right), all shown at exaggerated angles.  The two circulation paths are surrounded by a cacophony of intersecting curvilinear and flat wall surfaces.  The natural light enters the space through the skylight and the windows of the building's back wall creating rich, pronounced/accentuated lighting effects, such as the shadows cast by the frame of the skylight (lower center).  The print is monochromatic in various beige and cream tones.",
