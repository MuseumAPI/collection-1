The chair's back corner posts terminate in a volute-like form at the top of the chair.   The chair's top rail, slightly arched, is bowed towards the back.  A rectangular panel of inset veneer is surrounded by beading.  The chair's splat is horizontal, composed of a small oblong-shaped rectangle faced with veneer, flanked on either side by horizontal coupled C-scrolls covered with foliage.  The C-scrolls terminate in volutes.  The seat flares from back to front, with straight edges.",
