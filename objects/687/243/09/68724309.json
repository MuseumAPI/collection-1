    "description": "A blue man with presumably shrugging with raised hands straddles the yellow head of an older woman, who seems to be laughing. An orange and black background extends behind them. The film title is printed vertically on yellow columns on the left and right sides of the poster. Additional markings: lower left - \"In the 2nd series, 16th part\"; lower right - \"Issued by Sovkino\" with stamp.",
    "justification": "This stunning poster displays all the characteristic graphic design elements of Stenberg posters: bold and bright colors, the combining of photomontage-like elements with other graphic imagery, disparities of scale, the use of black horizontal bars to emphasize the figures and suggest spatial recession, the highlight surrounding figural contours, as well as the Stenberg\u2019s printed signature.&amp;nbsp; The film advertised in the poster, \u201cAdventures of a Foundling\u201d has not yet been identified by Cooper Hewitt.&amp;nbsp; Although Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cThe Kid\u201d was made in 1921, it was not released in the Soviet Union until 1929, several years after the date of this poster. A 1916 film titled \u201cThe Foundling\u201d with Mary Pickford is a possibility, but given the date discrepancy it appears unlikely.&amp;nbsp; \nThis poster was produced by the Stenberg brothers at the height of the new Soviet film industry.&amp;nbsp; From 1923-25, the number of cinemas more than doubled.&amp;nbsp; Sovkino, a government film company was formed in 1924, and by 1927 was producing over 100 films a year.&amp;nbsp; Foreign films remained popular as well, and it is possible that this poster advertises a foreign movie released under another title or a lesser known Soviet film from the period.
