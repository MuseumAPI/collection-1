    "justification": "Otto and Gertrud Natzler were among the leading figures of the modern studio ceramics movement. Noted for their refined forms and intricate and colorful glazes, the Natzlers worked collaboratively until Gertrud\u2019s death in 1971. Otto trained as a textile designer in Vienna,&amp;nbsp;and met Gertrud in 1933 while she was studying ceramics. By&amp;nbsp; 1938, the couple&amp;nbsp;emigrated from&amp;nbsp;Austria to the United States, arriving with only a potter\u2019s wheel and a small kiln. Settling in Los Angeles, the couple made ends meet by teaching&amp;nbsp;and working in tandem on their ceramics. They perfected their glazes and refined the forms over three decades, from 1939 to 1971, creating poetic objects of beauty and visual eloquence. While Gertrud worked as the master potter, Otto experimented with glazes and further became a master at the kiln. Gertrud\u2019s thin-walled elegant forms echo Art Nouveau elements of the Vienna Secessionist movement and are the epitome of weightless grace and refinement<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a>. Otto perfected over 2,000 glazes, meticulously deciphering which glaze and texture to apply on each vessel.\n\nThese bowls and pot are being offered by the granddaughter of the original owner, Friederich Rotter, who was her father\u2019s stepfather. Rotter knew the Natzlers through his home furnishings business and gallery, Der Wohnraum, located in central Vienna in the 1930s. While the granddaughter confirms that Rotter\u2019s Vienna firm did sell the Natzler\u2019s work, the objects being offered to the museum are probably from the Natzler\u2019s output after their arrival in the US, since refugees were not allowed to leave Austria with many possessions or more than about $20. Rotter and the Natzlers continued their friendship after settling in the US. The donor remembers her grandfather having an interior design firm in New York, and seeing these objects as a child, over 45 years ago, in her grandparents' East 86th Street apartment.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> http:\/\/www.artscenecal.com\/ArticlesFile\/Archive\/Articles2000\/Articles0600\/NatzlerA.html",
