    "description": "Horizontal sheet tipped vertically into binding.  It was once folded and has a large crease line down the center of the sheet, dividing it into two halves.  The left side has two registers of sketches; above is a quick sketch of an arcade, while below is a grid of lines.  The right side is also divided into two registers: the upper sketch also illustrates a section of an arcade in elevation quickly sketched, but the various components parts of the arcade are identified by dimensions.  This is repeated for one bay in the bottom register, again with many notations about dimensions as well as inscriptions that appear unrelated to the sketches.",
