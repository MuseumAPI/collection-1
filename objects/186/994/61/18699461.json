    "description": "Long length of polyester which is folded in the 'mountains and valleys' origami pattern. Pieces of dye transfer paper are inserted between the folds at the edges. The folds are permanently pressed in and the dye transfer effected in one step. The dye permeates the folds to varying degrees.",
    "justification": "Origami Pleat was designed by Reiko Sudo, one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers. Educated at Musashino Art University, she and Junichi Arai were the co-founders in 1984 of the Japanese company and store, NUNO, which produces textiles of extraordinary ingenuity and beauty. Sudo and the other designers at NUNO combine tradition and advanced technologies with remarkable creativity, which led them to the forefront of textile design field.\nOrigami Pleat is a contemporary interpretation of centuries-old hand pleating. It is made by folding the polyester fabric at sharp, crisp angles\u2014like origami (the Japanese art of folding paper). Its color gradation is achieved by sandwiching colored dye-transfer paper between the fabric and outer paper during the heat-transfer process. This process not only transfers the colors, but permanently presses the pleats. At the time of proposed acquisition, the special pleating process is patent pending.",
