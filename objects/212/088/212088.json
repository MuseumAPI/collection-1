  "description": "Thirty four pictographs designed as part of an international signage system to communicate important information simply and legibly. In the black, red and tan poster, the thirty four symbols present a visual vocabulary of images consistent in weight, shape and form.  The subject catagories, arranged down the left side, are Public Services, Concessions, Processing Activities and Regulations.  The actual symbols are arranged in a grid, with each catagory separated by a horizontal line. The title, in large black letters at upper edge of poster, boldly states the poster's mission.\r\n",
