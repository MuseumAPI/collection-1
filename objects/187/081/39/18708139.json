    "description": "This interior displays a combination of flamboyant chinoiserie motifs and mundane English Regency chairs and case furniture. Bamboo is used in additional furniture, as well as in door panels, shutter panels and the fretwork frame of the overmantel mirror. The ceiling frieze painted blue with gold Chinese characters and the hanging birdcage compliment the Chinese wallpaper and porcelains.  Books and baskets are casually scattered on the floor; flowers and plants, in true Victorian style, decorate the room. The elaborate drapery treatment is very much of the period.",
