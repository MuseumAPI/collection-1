  "description": "The head, turning right, is positioned on a long neck. Curly hair frames the face, ending at ear level on the left and just below on the right. Under thin eyebrows,  the eyes, barely visible within almost closed eyelids, glance downward. Dark marks appear in the nostrils, under the bottom lip and under the chin. The length of the face and neck are emphasized by shading. Just below the neck, a series of S-curves slanting upward to the right suggests a neckline or necklace.",
