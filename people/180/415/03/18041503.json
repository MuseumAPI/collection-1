Eisler completed a year-long independent study at Parsons School of Design and eventually became a teacher there, and later, chairman of the K. O. V. Studio (Concept Object Meaning). After 25 years in the United States, Eisler and her family moved back to Prague where she heads the Jewelry department at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design.
