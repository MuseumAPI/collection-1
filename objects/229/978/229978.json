  "description": "This sitting room is clearly situated in a summer residence. Three large French doors, opened to the outside, are dressed with billowing white pelmets. The light wooden floor is laid in a simple geometric pattern and the furniture, in the Biedermeier style, is upholstered, most likely in printed cotton. A center table, covered with a plaid cloth, holds books and a plant. A writing desk, additional plants, a birdcage, paintings and a dog curled up on the sofa create the ambience of a summer retreat.",
