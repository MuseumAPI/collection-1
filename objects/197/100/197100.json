  "description": "Underneath a narrow horizontal space containing the heading, in small capitals, Florent's Holiday Advisory, the page is divided vertically into three columns headed by the numerals 1, 2 and 3. Thick black bands serve to circumscribe the outer rectangular space, as well as to enclose the horizontal and vertical divisions. In large upper and lower case type, Column 1 is headed Do/ Something and Column 2, Send/ Money; Column 3, in script, is headed Be/ Happy. Each heading is accompanied below by an illustrative pictograph of a man. In the lowest quarter of each column, delineated by a thin horizontal line, is information pertaining to the headings: organizations needing volunteers in the first column, organizations soliciting contributions in the second, and the Restaurant Florent in the third.",
