  "description": "The bottle in the present photograph has a short neck, topped by a shallow imprinted cap with ridged edging. Below the neck, the bottle widens into rounded, sloping shoulders, and then forms a tapered body. The surface appears to be fabricated of a white quilted material. On the front of the bottle, just below the shoulders, manhattan cocktail, styled in a hand-lettered script, forms a circle; and clic, in capitals of an original hand-lettered type, is imprinted within in black, with a large gray dot over the i. A collar encircles the neck; a strip extends from it a short way down the visible side of the bottle, on the left; and a seal or badge, diagonally imprinted Schenley, is superimposed on its front. An imprinted triangle, its base parallel to the bottle's bottom edge, is affixed just above that edge and is imprinted clic in a smaller version.  Additional imprinting within the triangle parallel to the edges is illegible.",
