  "description": "In the present frontal view of a female with an oval face, the light blue eyes looking straight ahead are the predominant feature. The pink tint of the lips supplies the only other touch of color. The subject wears a cloche or helmet-shaped hat, patterned in circles and squiggles; wisps of hair escape onto the forehead and the sides of the face. The rounded neckline of her blouse is edged in a wide band composed of v-shapes; beneath the band, short vertical lines, from shoulder to shoulder, suggest tucks. Above the right shoulder, Ellen/ Nutaar/ 1922 is handwritten, the letters l reaching upward above the others.",
