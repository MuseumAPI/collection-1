Design is incomplete and shows a central pillar twined with a grape vine. At the base, a woman in flowing robes over armor is seated with one hand on her breast, the other pointing to the right. Beside her stands a young man, Bacchus, a wreath of grapes in his hair, the thyrsus entwined with grapes in his left hand, and in his right hand, a wine cup which he offers to the woman. At back, architectural details such as a lighthouse, a galley under full sail, with oars. At right, a rustic scene of a girl dancing while a piper plays. On Component B, lower right, a naked boy crowned with grapes on the back of a leopard. Additional details include: wine pitcher, vase, foliage and birds.",
