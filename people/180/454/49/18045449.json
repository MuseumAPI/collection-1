    "biography": "Vinken is a versatile Dutch textile designer, painter, and sculptor. He studied at the Academy of Industrial Design, Eindhoven. In the 1980\u2019s Vinken became well known for his screen-printed curtains which he referred to as \u201cpleated paintings.\u201d Vinken has also worked with fabrics and paintings on a monumental scale. Imagery in these works tends to resemble bodily forms and forms in nature; limbs, skin, twigs, or branches are common themes. \n\nVinken developed innovative artworks in which he designed carpet fragments and arranged them in patterns as works of art on the floor of a room. His work strives to create something new and original beyond the given function of an object. \nThe artist has received several awards, including the Gelderland Design Award in 1997 and the Dutch Design Award in 2010.",
