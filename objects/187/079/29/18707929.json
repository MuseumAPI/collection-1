    "description": "Sectional elevation (above) and plan (below) for a twenty step 'English Style' spiral staircase. Starts as a single flight, and then splits into two curved sections before rejoining to form a single flight at the top.  Numbered annotations on each step.",
    "justification": "This well-executed drawing appears to correspond directly to one of the staircase models given to the museum by Eugene V. and Clare E. Thaw. The drawing, which shows both an elevation and a cross-section of the staircase\u2019s revolutions, represents an example of compagnonnage training in design at a considerably earlier date than the other staircase drawings in Cooper Hewitt\u2019s collection. With a date of 1836, the drawing demonstrates the continuum of this system of design training and of the forms taught. The inscription on the drawing also suggests that it was executed in Paris, which indicates that the work was probably completed as a demonstration of design mastery in the journeyman phase of compagnonnage training.",
