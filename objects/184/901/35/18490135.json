    "gallery_text": "Delicate, curling bracken fronds seem to follow the swirling course of some river or stream in this serene composition, representative of the Japanese art of Katagami. The creation of such stencils involves a long and laborious process, whereby several sheets of paper, taken from the inner bark of the Mulberry tree, are layered together with persimmon juice lacquer to form a strong yet supple support. The design is then carefully cut out from this stencil and held together using silk threads. Typically, the completed stencil would then be used in the katasome resist-dye process on textiles to obtain a printed motif on a kimono, for example. This involves placing the stencil on the dyed fabric and covering it over with rice paste. The motifs were often abstract interpretations inspired by nature \u2013 such is the case for this one.",
    "label_text": "Katagami, the stencils used in the Japanese resist-dye process of katazome to produce printed textiles, typically feature abstract motifs drawn from nature, traditional folklore, and literature. The curving, rhythmic lines shown here convey moving water. The simplicity of the design belies the laborious process of carving the stencil.",
