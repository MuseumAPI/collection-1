  "description": "The design, featuring white letters on a ribbed black background, reproduces a restaurant menu board, in which movable plastic letters, fitting into the grooves of a board, may be rearranged according to the day's specials. In the present object, headed November, centered at the top, only the second line of type refers to food: soup, boudin and warm tarts. The remaining seven lines describe typical weather conditions of the month and provide the restaurant's name, telephone and hours of business. MNCO appears in the lower left hand corner.",
