The year before, she had visited Paris with Ruth Reeves and met her husband, Edward McKnight Kauffer. While her most prolific work was textiles in the form of hangings, carpeting and rugs, she is also known to have produced wallpaper, graphics, and illustrations. In 1934 she founded her own company and received commissions from major clients, such as the luxury hotels the Berkeley of London and the London Savoy, as well as ocean liners.",
