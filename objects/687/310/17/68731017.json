    "justification": "Before Kodak introduced the first Brownie model in 1900, photography was reserved for rigid portraits and formal occasions, a skill only accessible to a select few and with fees attached. By 1910, snapshots had become ubiquitous in American culture for documenting birthdays, holidays and happy everyday moments. These snapshots were almost always taken with Kodak Brownie cameras. The first Brownie was an unassuming black box camera meant to be held at waist-level to capture a photo. It sold for one dollar, and Kodak pledged that it was simple enough for a school boy or girl to use while also providing joy to grown adults. True to its slogan, \u201cyou press the button\u2014we do the rest,\u201d Kodak promised to develop the film for these clean cut cameras, saving consumers from the complexities of the darkroom. In the first year after its introduction, Kodak sold 100,000 Brownies. The company went on to sell millions more and to produce dozens of updated models over the next several decades.\nBy the early 1930s, new features and materials had driven up the price of cameras. For this reason, the design for the Kodak Baby Brownie presented a special challenge for industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague. Kodak was searching for an updated model that could be sold at the original Brownie price of one dollar. The company\u2019s goals were to draw a new mass market to photography and drive up the consumption of No. 127 roll film. Teague's resulting design is a picture of simplicity in appearance and function. The Baby Brownie camera has a single shutter speed and a retractable metal viewfinder. The compact black body is composed of molded Bakelite, and any imperfections are skillfully disguised by a series of Art Deco ribs encircling&amp;nbsp;the camera's contoured&amp;nbsp;form. The Kodak Baby Brownie was wildly popular, with four million cameras selling at one dollar between 1934 and 1941. Teague\u2019s thrifty yet sufficiently modern design is a significant factor in its success. ",
