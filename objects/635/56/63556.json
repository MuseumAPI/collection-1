In center of each side, horizontal rectangle with lunette; each lunette has central standing figure flanked by two seated figures. One standing figure holds lyre (other figures hard to decipher). In each of 8 triangular compartments is dancing female figure holding wreathe above her head and facing corner, which apparently was to receive stucco decoration. Central panel remains blank, apparently for painting by another artist.",
