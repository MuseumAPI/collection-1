The whole is surrounded by a strawberry vine border. \r\nThe verses read: \r\n\r\nHow blest the maid whose circleing (sic) years improve\r\nHer God the object of her warmest love\r\nWhose tender years successive as they glide\r\nThe book the needle and the pen divide\r\nWho sees her parents hearts exult with joy\r\nAnd the fond tear stand sparkling in her eye\r\n\r\nJesus permit thy gracious name to stand\r\nAs the efforts of an youthful hand\r\nAnd while her finger on the canvas move\r\nEngage her tender thoughts to seek thy love\r\nWith thy dear children let her have a heart\r\nAnd write thy name thyself upon her heart\r\n",
