  "description": "The present profile view of a female features a wide forehead, straight nose, full lips, and rounded chin. The thick eyebrow and lower eyelid slant upward. Waves frame the face on the right, ending below the invisible ear, where a rounded shape, possibly an earring, shows through. Dark outlines, shading on the right side of the face and below the chin line, and the downward curve of the mouth produce a menacing expression.\r\n\r\nWithin a framed outline, the initials JC, accompanied by two dots, appear below on the left. The ensemble perhaps simulates letters nailed into a plaque.",
