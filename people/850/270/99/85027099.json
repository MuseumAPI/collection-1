In Francesco Franchi\u2019s world, every layout and illustration must walk the line between journalism and graphic design. Franchi studied industrial design at the Politecnico of Milan and completed an ERASMUS exchange at the London Metropolitan University. He currently works as art director of IL (Ideas and Lifestyles), a monthly magazine that supplements Italy\u2019s leading economics newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore.

Above all else, Franchi\u2019s work balances artistic and utilitarian function.",
