  "description": "A townhouse in Greenwich Village, with/ a doorman, a garage and three enormous terraces introduces the promotional copy for the Memphis (condominiums) downtown. The serif-style type is largest in the first line, somewhat smaller in the second, and smallest in the remaining eight lines following underneath. The narrative is interspersed with seven pictographs, either literally illustrative of the preceding word (e.g. doorman) or representing a concept (e.g. crown for rich). A photographic illustration of the Memphis (condominiums) project appears on the lower right of the copy. An architect's rendering of an interior room plan is reproduced beneath the copy on the diagonal, its right hand edge intersecting the photograph. In the lower left hand corner, Memphis [condominiums logo]/ downtown, completes the design.",
