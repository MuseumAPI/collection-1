    "justification":"Pause is from the designer\u2019s Chatter collection.&amp;nbsp; With a pattern of repeating large-scale commas and periods, Pause&amp;nbsp;incorporates&amp;nbsp;typographc characters not frequently highlighted.\nTypography has been used as a motif in wallpaper design since the 1920s reaching its peak in the 1960s.&amp;nbsp; Earlier examples tend to involve more words and phrases, while designs from the 1960s begin using typographic characters as decorative motifs.&amp;nbsp; Typography was used much earlier on children's wallpapers but served an educational rather than decorative purpose.&amp;nbsp; French artist Jean Lur\u00e7at inserted Dada messages into some of his wallpaper designs in the 1920s.&amp;nbsp; One of the&amp;nbsp;most well-known examples of type used as a motif on wallpaper is the design by Alexander Girard for Herman Miller in 1953. While the use of typography as a decorative element has been around for a while&amp;nbsp;this design shows it being used in a unique way and help show the evolution of type as a motif.",
