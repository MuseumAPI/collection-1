  "description": "Vertical sheet depicting an elevation of a large building set into a hill that is seen from the corner.  The street level has signage for small shops that are contained within.  This is also the smallest of the three stories, as each subsquent level above hangs over the one below.  The street level seems to be of masonry with many windows, while the upper stories are half-timber and plastered.  At the first and second stories the eaves create a deep overhang and are visibly supported from underneath by large shaped brackets.  The building has a slate or tile roof, and a picturesque roofline with many dormers, gables, and chimneys.",
