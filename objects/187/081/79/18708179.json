    "description": "The room is designed with a geometric plasterwork ceiling which echoes the geometric parquet floor.  A sip-branched gilt and patinated bronze chandelier is suspended from a central rosette.  The room is sparsely decorated with Rococo Revival chairs with Victorian-influenced fringe and antimacassars.  Plant stands and groupings of small portraits and engravings [?] are typical of mid-nineteenth century interiors.  The heavy marble chimneypiece, a candelabra, an overmantle mirror, and a gilt-bronze clock under a glass dome are extravagant elements in an otherwise bourgeois setting.",
