  "description": "A female head in right profile, diagonally enclosed in an elliptically-shaped moon, and three stars outside the lower right of the moon, comprise the design. The edge of the tightly waved hair, grazing the eyebrow, forms a sharp diagonal from forehead to unseen ear. The downward-cast eye is heavily fringed, the nose straight, the lips full and the chin rounded. Heavy shading throughout intensifies the white highlights of the skin on forehead, nose and cheek. A white highlight also appears in the form of a thin curve on the far right side of the moon.",
