    "justification": "The minimal, no frills form of Grcic's 1999 May Day lamp, for Italian lighting manufacturer, Flos, was inspired in part by the simple form of an auto mechanic's work lamp (Grcic is a fan or Formual One racing). Even the name is a nod to the idea of work, May Day being International Workers Day. Grcic said,  &quot;...I search for something that motivates a design beyond just giving an object a new look.... I am looking for something that allows me to turn an abstract brief into a personal response&quot;. The portable lamp's basic cone shape is composed of a polypropylene diffuser with a brightly colored cap that incorporates a hook, two prongs, cord, on\/off button, and bulb housing. It is a practical and carefully thought out design, elegant in its simplicity and proportions. May Day goes beyond mere utility. While the large hook is functional, allowing the lamp to be held or hung from ceiling or wall, car hood or work place, and the prongs act as a cord winder, the cap, as a whole, adds interest and a pop of color (offered also in orange, green, blue, and black) making the lamp suitable for a home or office setting. May Day can also be a table lamp, quite stable sitting on its circular diffuser, offering a soft glow. It was designed for multiple positions and purposes to meet the varied needs of todays way of life.",
