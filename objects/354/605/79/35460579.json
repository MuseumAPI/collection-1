    "description": "in the form of a Renaissance chapel abutting a brick building behind it, the chapel's front portico of single story, with three arches raised on double columns, surmounted by a single window in the wall, below an open triangular pediment, the back building with three roof tops.",
    "justification": "This early model appears to be of a Renaissance chapel of the era of Ferdinand dei Medici (1549-1609)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;appended to a larger palace.&amp;nbsp; As Ferdinand was made a cardinal at the age of 14 in 1562, although never ordained, he remained interested in the church, and was an administrator in Rome. There he created the Villa Medici, collecting great works of art.&amp;nbsp; It is possible that the chapel or church represented by this model was one for which he was benefactor while a cardinal.&amp;nbsp; The building itself is typical&amp;nbsp; both of Romanesque churches later&amp;nbsp;given Renaissance facades and ones built entirely in the Renaissance. The fenestration suggests that the whole building is Renaissance as many early churches had no windows on the side.&amp;nbsp; \nThe significance of the model, not only for date, is the successful rendering of different materials on a wood base. The marble facade and columns, and the brickwork are all sculpted in carved gesso that was then painted with the appropriate colors. Even the roof is created in a verisimilitudinous manner, capturing the feel of the original&amp;nbsp;materials, giving the viewer an accurate idea of what the actual building looks like. Initial investigations have revealed some similar Tuscan examples of the Renaissance, but not this exact conformation. As there is no reference to Tuscany in the inscription, it suggests that the buildings are there, where there would not be the need to add this reference.&amp;nbsp; In Rome, not in Tuscany, it might have been part of the inscription, unless made for him.\nThe ability to carve, and create the feeling of different materials at a high level, is one prized both by model makers and by others engaged in the art of trompe l'oeil which plays such a major role in design history.",
