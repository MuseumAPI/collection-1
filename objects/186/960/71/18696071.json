  "justification": "Wool Dot Gather, designed in 1993 by Mita and manufactured at his family\u2019s textile company, Mitasho, is made of wool and rayon. The textile has a very rich textural surface created by a combination of patterning in the weaving process, as well as shrinking in the finishing. The white plain woven wool forms both the dots and stripes, while the white rayon forms the pleats in between. Mita\u2019s innovation is in his ability to understand and exploit the unique properties of the different yarns to create a particular and premeditated effect. This textile is meant to be used both for fashion purposes as well as for interior decoration. ",
