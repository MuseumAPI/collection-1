  "description": "The word \"sustainability\" is presented as the infinity symbol, with no beginning and no end, constantly renewing itself. Resembling a blueprint, the architect's primary tool for constructing a new building project, Paula Scher has presented the word \"sustainability\" in plan, section and elevation. The white letters on a blue ground provide maximum legibility while the reference to architectural plans allows for an intense scrutiny of the word itself.\r\nInstructions for assembly at bottom.",
