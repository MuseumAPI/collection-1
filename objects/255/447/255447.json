  "description": "Background: large grey-and-white plane at right joins a lighter grey-and-white plane at left on a diagonal, terminating at a third plane at bottom, in faded blue. Through this room-like arrangement, \"windows\" are cut: one rectangular at left and one crescent-shaped in center, opening to photographs of the Universe, while a photograph of Earth emerges from the lower blue plane. Seated on the crescent-shaped window is a woman, tinted yellow, half-covered with blue drapery, caressed by a man, tinted fuchsia, who appears as only a facial profile and a hand. \r\nInscriptions: the tile, at top center- \" IL MONDO DELLA LUNA\", at bottom- \"OPENHAS ZURICH ZU GAST IM THEATER AM STADTGARTEN WINTERTHUR\",  and credits at lower right- \" von Josef Hayden / Adam Fischer / Matthias Schohefeldt / Kersten Paulsen / Stadtorchester Winterthur / [...] / ab 4. september\".",
