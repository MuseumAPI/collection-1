    "description": "Photographically captured panel of drywall or sheetrock marked with graphite and prepped with joint compound, one of a series of ten different panels.",
    "justification": "One complete set of ten panels of Drywall wallpaper by contemporary artist Urs Fischer are being offered as a gift by the artist. Each of the panels is a photographic rendering of a unique composition of joint compound and graphite on a 4x8 foot panel of drywall. All were shot on site and then printed in the artist\u2019s studio. \n&amp;nbsp;\nEach of the panels offers a realistic rendering of a sheet of drywall, all prepped and awaiting its final surface coating. To achieve this high degree of realism, Fischer entered an actual construction site and painstakingly photographed ten different drywall panels. Each panel was literally shot hundreds of times, at very close range, moving inch by inch across the surface of the panels. A single image file was then created from these multiples and used to print the final work. This exacting photography and follow-up Photoshop work is enhanced by the digital printing which allows the wallpaper to pick up minute details that make it nearly impossible to distinguish the wallpaper from actual drywall. From the marking of the drywall with graphite, to the application and smoothing of the joint compound, to the miscellaneous smudges and fingerprints, every detail is caught in this hyper-realistic depiction. The wallpaper is unpretentious and exudes confidence, and Fischer\u2019s ability to capture the raw beauty of this material elevates drywall to a new level.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis is the first collection of Fischer\u2019s wallpaper being produced as an open edition, with panels printed and sold on demand. He has created trompe l\u2019oeil wallpaper panels for prior installations but the panels were only available in very limited editions. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe Drywall wallpaper is relevant to two different groups of papers within the department: those with a trompe l\u2019oeil or faux finish and papers designed by artists. Since its invention wallpaper has frequently been designed to imitate other materials, and historically it copied materials deemed more luxe such as exotic hardwoods, precious metals or stone, embossed leather, or exquisite woodwork or draperies. Faux finish wallpapers were used to replace these materials when they were not available in the quantities necessary, could not be manipulated in the desired fashion, or when use of the original was cost prohibitive. It is only during the twentieth century that wallpapers began imitating more common surfaces, and this was usually done as a cost-effective measure, such as wood grain papers imitating paneling. It is most unusual for wallpaper to imitate a lesser surfacing material. The Museum recently acquired a set of Scrapwood wallpapers designed by Piet Hein Eek where the designs copy surfaces created with bits of found wood. While the material itself was very common, Hein Eek\u2019s manipulation of the wood\u2019s inherent scars and imperfections to create beautiful patterns was an artistic achievement. For the Drywall wallpaper, Fischer is copying a much more base material, used in the construction of most buildings but always covered by surfacing materials deemed more appropriate to a finished interior. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThe Museum\u2019s collection of artist-designed wallpapers primarily contains examples from the early-20th century onward but skilled artists were also employed to create scenic wallpapers during the first half of the 19th century. Some of the more notable artist-designed wallpapers in the collection include Charles Dana Gibson, Charles Burchfield, Andy Warhol, Niki de St. Phalle, and William Wegman.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe addition of these panels would enhance the collections of both the trompe l\u2019oeil and artist-designed wallpapers. While these panels follow in the tradition of faux finish wallpapers they are unique in that this is the first time wallpaper has been made to imitate the very material they are normally pasted over. The wallpapers capture Fischer\u2019s fascination with common and found objects and his use of these objects as inspiration. The addition of these panels to the collection would offer surprising and unexpected examples that will allow the Museum to continue showing the evolution of these two groups and help keep each of these collections vibrant.",
