In the middleground, at the left hand side, three musicians play instruments.  At the right hand side, a man carries a tray with fruit.  Behind the man with the tray is a tree with white-blue blossoms.  In the background, at the left hand side, stands a man holding a horse.  To the right of him stands a female figure.  At her feet sit two other female figures.  A hilly landscape is visible in the distance.  The entire scene is framed by a curtain.  At the bottom of the sheet, there is a suggestion of the wall molding, rendered in graphite.",
