    "justification": "From Acquisition Justification:\n&quot;Context: The tubular steel chair stands as one of the most emblematic pieces of Modernist furniture.&amp;nbsp; While a number of designers created later versions, including Mies van der Rohe, the original tubular steel chair was created by Marcel Breuer in 1926.&amp;nbsp; The then-26-year-old Breuer&amp;nbsp;was one of the first six apprentices in the Bauhaus furniture workshop in 1921, and by 1924 he was its head. Before he left the Bauhaus in 1928, Breuer also designed a number of important interiors, including the personal homes of a number of other Bauhaus masters like Lazlo Maholy-Nagy (where B5 chairs were utilized in the dining room), and Walter Gropius.Breuer experimented for some time before he found a successful method for bending extruded, industrial, steel tubes into chair forms.&amp;nbsp; In 1926 Breuer was awarded patents for seven tubular steel furniture designs, and 1927 Breuer and a colleague created&amp;nbsp;the furniture company Standard-M\u00f6bel,&amp;nbsp;specifically to manufacture and sell tubular steel pieces to a wider public.&amp;nbsp; The B5 chair was one of the models sold in the company\u2019s initial line.&amp;nbsp; Due to financial reasons Standard-M\u00f6bel was sold to Austrian furniture company Thonet in 1928.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe chair:\nThe B5 chair under discussion dates from the short-lived Standard-M\u00f6bel company, and as such represents an extremely rare and early example of this form.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A nearly identical Standard-M\u00f6bel B5 is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and was recently exhibited in its Modernism: Designing a New World 1914-1939 exhibition. Because the B5 was subsequently overshadowed by the more popular B3 model (commonly known as the \u201cWassily\u201d)&amp;nbsp;its production was more limited.&quot;",
