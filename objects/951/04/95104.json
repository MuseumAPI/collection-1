At the upper right of the ornamental border, the seated figure of Britannia holds a sword and shield to vanquish the figures (at lower right) of Envy (a bare-breasted woman holding a snake), Superstition (a blindfolded figure holding a torch) and Spain (a fallen man, holding a sword, next to a tower and lion).   At the upper left, the personification of True Religion (a draped, seated woman holding a book and torch) presides above lightening and t fleeing figures of Hypocrisy, Ignorance and Popery (woman and fox, devil, monk at lower left).",
