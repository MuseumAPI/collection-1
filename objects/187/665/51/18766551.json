    "provenance":"Donor purchased the two Grantil sample books from a private collector in France ca. 2000. For the remaining non-Grantil pieces, the French, Belgian and English papers were acquired from various sources in Europe, while the American samples were acquired from private collections in the United States.",

    "description":"See attached list.",
    "justification":"The pages from the sample books are a mix of exuberant and vivid designs, in both modern and traditional styling, that contain many examples of matching sidewall and border papers, sidewall coordinates, and independent sidewall papers. The sidewall coordinates could be used alone or together, creating some very striking interiors. A number of the samples have applied lithograph illustrations showing these coordinates in situ. The two books contain similarly styled papers though there are no duplicates. Many of the samples have unique textural patterns, both printed and embossed.\nThe remaining papers, unrelated to the Grantil production, are individual samples. Most are of French manufacture, while a number were produced in England, the United States, and Belgium. The samples include wood block as well as machine-printed papers, and comprise a wide range of styles and periods. This group of papers fills a number of gaps in the collection, including borders in the aesthetic and art nouveau styles, sanitary or washable sidewalls and borders, and examples of mid-20th century French production. Several of the sidewall papers are designed\/produced by known individuals, including Andre Groult, Paul Gruin, Paul Follot, and Shand Kydd. ",
