  "description": "A male head in left profile wears what appears to be a helmet or helmet-shaped hat. The eye and lips are closed; the nose slightly hooked, but pointed at the tip; and the lips and chin rounded. Irwin D. Wolf (or Irwind Wolf) is written in pencil in capital letters just beneath, and touching, the head. With the sheet turned top-to-bottom, Catalog of/ Awards is imprinted on the lower right. The designer's signature and the year are inscribed along the left edge of the page.",
