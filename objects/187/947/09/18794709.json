    "description": "Design of overlapping typographic letters, having a very random appearance, printed in white on a deep gray ground. The scale of the letters range from quite small to quite large, while the scale and opacity of the letters creates a sense of depth.",
    "justification": "This design is from &quot;The Ink Collection&quot;, Miller\u2019s second collection for Knoll Textiles. Based on Miller\u2019s experiments with the liquid movement of ink, and how ink reacts as it moves across the surface of paper, each design has a random look but still maintains a feeling of control. &quot;Drip&quot; has the appearance of loosely formed, overlapping letters on a slate blackboard, with the letters\u2019 extremities appearing to drip and pool. \nKnoll Textiles has consistently included in their production a number of wallcoverings suitable for both residential and commercial interiors which break away from the traditional neutral wallcovering. \u201cThe Ink Collection\u201d is part of this group, with brightly colored bold designs that create energy in a room, rather than merely forming a background. Both Drip and Drop possess a spontaneous feel, keeping them light-hearted and appropriate for use in a variety of interior settings, from children\u2019s rooms to meeting rooms.\nThe Ink Collection wallcoverings are eco-friendly as they are printed on Recore, a vinyl wallcovering composed of 30% recycled content which is Greenguard certified for low chemical emissions. The non-woven backing is made from recycled polyester.",
