  "description": "The present object, here flattened, in actual use would be affixed to a jar and viewed in the round, so that the far left and right partial spiral icons would form whole spirals. Three lines of horizontal type, Silver/ Bennetts/ Polish, are designed to be read vertically. Silver and polish are imprinted in the designer's hand-lettered style capitals in silver on black bands, while Bennetts is imprinted in stencil-style capitals in black on a narrower silver band. The spiral icons appear on the two black bands between the repeats of silver and polish. A blank narrow silver band at the top and a wider one at the bottom, imprinted with two lines of small sans-serif black type regarding instructions in the use of the polish, complete the design.",
