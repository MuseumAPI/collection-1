    "biography":"Herter Brothers was the foremost American firm in the production of high-quality Renaissance Revival and Aesthetic Movement furniture.  The German-bornHerter Brothers, Christian (1839-1883) and Gustave (1830-1892) Herter, were  highly-skilled craftsmen who worked in New York during the second half of the nineteenth century. Gustave emigrated from Wurttemberg in 1848, and already owned what was a leading cabinet-making and interior decorating company by the time he was joined by Christian in 1859.  Christian became a full partner in what became Herter Brothers in 1864, after which the firm's business greatly expanded.  Despite this, Christian spent some time in France in 1868-9, and in 1870 went to England.  The firm took advantage of the Herters' European training and knowledge of style there to create cosmopolitan interiors and furniture for clients all over the United States, and even in England, as their business developed.",
