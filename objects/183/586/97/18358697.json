    "description": "Intended to be executed in stone, probably in gilt bronze parts. The mensa is outlined. The retable has a dado below with projecting lateral parts. The three main sections show framings of panels. Four fluted Doric pilasters at left support the the entablature. In the central interval is a niche with a standing shell in the concha. In the lateral intervals are what are probably smaller niches, with decorated dados below; with cherubim in panels above them. Laterally are butress volutes, with bunches of fruit hanging above. The triglyph frieze shows rosettes. On top is a low attic and vases containing fire standing upon the corners. In the center is a pediment consisting of a panel with a dove, between volutes and on top a circular pediment with a shell.",
