    "description": "The Don Wallance Papers, 1936-1990, document the work of American industrial designer Donald Aaron Wallance, from his enrollment in the Design Laboratory School in 1936 to his death in 1990. \nThe materials trace Wallance's career, including his designs for tableware, furniture, and household accessories, and his role as a researcher and writer on American industrial design. \nThis collection consists of sketches, drawings, photographs, correspondence, and reference materials, in addition to publicity and promotional materials. \nExtensive documentation exists on Wallance's pioneering designs for stainless steel flatware for H. E. Lauffer Company and his experimental furniture for the U.S. Army, Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, and the Hard Manufacturing Company. Thorough documentation of his research for his landmark book, \"Shaping America's Products,\" is included. The collection also contains a substantial amount of information on the Design Laboratory School, the first industrial design school in the United States to be patterned after the Bauhaus.",
