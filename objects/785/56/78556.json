  "description": "Vertical sheet with numerous sketches of architectural elements.  Clockwise from bottom left: a dormer with ogee-shaped roof, gutter, and small gargoyle spout at the corner.  This same spout is drawn to the left.  Above this is a horizontal fountain spout in the shape of a man blowing into a pipe.  In the top half of the sheet are three sketches: below left is a window made of five round-arched lancets that graduate in size. The window is flanked by louvered shutters.  Above is the arched top of a doorway filled with greyish black scrolling ironwork.  At right is a dormer with a tiled roof that cantilevers far over the window opening below it.  The cantilever is supported by ogee brackets on either side of the window.",
