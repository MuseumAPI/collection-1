    "biography": "(Draft ST)\nIsraeli artist Esther Knobel is a highly original thinker, investigator, and maker, strongly motivated by, and attached to, such themes as family and nationality. She is especially sensitive to the power and importance of making, craftsmanship, and artisanal skills -- the interaction between head and hand, the skilled worker and society, topics she addresses in her book, The Mind in the Hand (2007). Knobel works with multiple materials in numerous processes, including assemblage, enamels, electroforming, and textile techniques -- such as knitting and embroidery with metal wire -- and object re-purposing. She holds a BFA from Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem and MFA from the Royal College of Art, London. Knobel is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Israel Ministry Prize in Art and Design and Andy (Andrea M. Bronfman) Prize for Contemporary Craft, Israel, and Fran\u00e7oise van den Bosch Prize from the Netherlands. Her work can be seen in museum collections worldwide, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh; Museum of Arts and Design, New York; Newark Museum, New Jersey: and Israel Museum, Jerusalem.",
