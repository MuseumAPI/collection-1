  "description": "This basket and tray are glazed earthenware but are made in the style of wicker ware. The ten-sided tray is circular with scalloped edges. The sides have varying loose cross hatched pattern while the center bottom consists of a tight cross hatched pattern with a row of green leaves around the border of the bottom piece. There are also leaves repeated, one in between each section of the ten sides.\r\n\r\nThe matching basket has the same construction, including the cross-hatched wicker style. However, the basket sits upon an attached foot and has the leaf green color around the top edge of the basket and handle.",
