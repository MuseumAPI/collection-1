    "gallery_text": "Hunter textiles, with an iconographic scheme of a mounted hunter leaping over his prey, were popular in late antique Egypt, and hunter textiles of many levels of expense and quality have survived.  The most luxurious of these were woven of silk on a drawloom by professional weavers.  Because drawloom technology encouraged patterns with repetition and bilateral symmetry, most hunter silks featured roundels filled with two hunters mirroring each other across a central stem.  Wool and linen tapestry weave textiles sought to imitate drawloom silks.  This material was much less expensive than silk and the technique could be executed on a small loom, either in a workshop or at home.  With its roundel design and bilateral symmetry, this textile was clearly an imitation of more expensive examples, both in silk and in higher quality wool and linen.",
