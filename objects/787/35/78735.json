Three well known campanile (bell towers) of Venice are depicted: at upper left, the campanile of San Francesco della Vigna; at upper right, the campanile of San Giorgio Maggiore; at bottom, the campanile of San Marco.  Each is a slender masonry structure with an arcaded belfry culminating in a tall steeple with finial. The campanile of San Francesco and San Giorgio are both reddish brown, likely indicating brick masonry, while the tower of San Marco is a pale gray with creamy white belfry, possibly indicating a type of marble.",
