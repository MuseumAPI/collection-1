    "description":"A large tree grows up the right side of the design with a large bird perched on a branch.  A cobweb suspends from its branches. Outgrowth of small flowers at treetop. A second bird sits at the base of the tree while a butterfly is in flight. Printed in a pale yellow and mauve on a white ground.",
    "justification":"Oakleaf is quite bold and shows the influence of Morris in its wandering, all-over oak branch design.&amp;nbsp; \nCobwebs is strong graphically but is printed in very muted colors, which is Marthe's preferred color palette.&amp;nbsp; The flatness of her designs is reminiscent of Pugin and Bawden. &amp;nbsp;\nBoth designs are current production from 2004 and were printed by linoleum block on a manual offset lithographic printing press.&amp;nbsp; ",
