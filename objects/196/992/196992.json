  "description": "1993-151-223a - Letterhead - In the top third of the page, music is imprinted all the way across in varied fonts and colors: large capital M in black sans-serif style; u, cut off at the top, thick and rounded, in gray; s, thinner and smaller, in light purple; i, italicized lower case, in pale lavender; and c, thin, cut off at the right edge of the page, in black. In the lower third of the page, from left of center extending to the right edge, a musical staff is imprinted in black. At the top edge, a black band, extending from left of center to the right edge, shows the telephone number imprinted in white; aligned with the band, a line of type comprising the company name and address is imprinted just above the bottom edge. A black triangle points downward to music, the first word in that line. A spattered pattern, heaviest on the left, completes the design.\r\n\r\n1993-151-223b - Envelope - The variegated music design is repeated, but with a larger space between the i and c to accommodate adressee information. The repeated  triangle now shows where the addressee material should begin. The company name and address appears on the bottom left, followed by a black band.",
