    "justification":"Origami Pleat was designed in 1997 by Reiko Sudo (b. 1953), one of Japan\u2019s most important contemporary textile designers and co-founder of NUNO. The textile is a contemporary interpretation of centuries-old hand pleating.&amp;nbsp; It is made by folding the polyester fabric at sharp, crisp angles \u2013 like origami or the Japanese art of folding paper.&amp;nbsp; Its color gradation is achieved by sandwiching colored dye-transfer paper between the fabric and outer paper during the heat-transfer process. This process not only transfers the colors, but permanently presses the pleats. At the time of acquisition, the special pleating process was patent pending.&amp;nbsp; ",
