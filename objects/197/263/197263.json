  "description": "Recto: Against a gray background, Talking Heads in white capitals is imprinted on a bright blue background, which is all across the top. A photograph of a pipette cleaner (the illustration is from a medical products catalogue) is centered two inches below, and below that is the album's unique identification number in small blue capitals. In the bottom quarter, a centered narrow blue band is imprinted with the album title in black capitals. Completing the design, on two lines centered below that band, are the numeral 12 in blue and, in smaller capitals, \"inch single\" in black.\r\nVerso: In the lower third, with approximately two inch margins, eight lines of production information in small black capitals are imprinted on the same gray background.",
