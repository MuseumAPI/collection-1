  "description": "M&Co's four page contribution to Print magazine's twenty-four page parody supplement is entitled \"Canada Finds an Identity, Finally/ Enfin, Canada Trouve une Identite;\" it spoofs both the graphic design techniques and the Canadian political and cultural issues of identity and bilingualism. Examples: focusing on logos by imprinting Canada in several typefaces; a photographic illustration of an antique statue overlaid by the Canadian maple leaf, substituted for the art historical fig leaf; and a bilingual signage series in black and white featuring the brief phrases eh and ai in several guises, footnoted by Emphatic typography/ leaves no room for misunderstanding. \r\n\r\nThe central design piece consists of color reproductions, eight on one full page (p. 64, unpaginated) and four on a half page, facing (p. 65), of submissions to the M&Co-sponsored bogus design contest for a new Canadian flag. P. 65: Row 3, left -  M&Co - A black and white design of a bottom-to-top diagonally placed canoe, with Canada across the top, in capitals, the three A's inverted. Row 1, left - Chiat/Day - An unidentified sea animal (walrus? seal?), emerging within a white spray from the bottom left corner against a background of blue water, with Canada in small type in the top right corner. Row 1, right - Tom Carnase - Canada, in white script, cenetered, within an ornate curlicued ribbon design, also in white, against a black background. Row 2, left - Saul Bass - On a white background, a red and white striped, maple leaf, stem down, the white stripes morphing into paddle-head shapes on the left. Row 2, right - Paula Scher -",
