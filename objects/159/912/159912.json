Border of swirling, interconnected figures, faces, breasts and curlicues in pink, yellow, purple, red, black. Text seems to grow out of an orange-and pink urn at the bottom of the page in a mushroom-like form. \r\n\r\nCentral block of text in stylized, distorted letters: \r\nCanned Heat\r\nGordon Lightfoot\r\nCold Blood\r\nFillmore\r\nWest\r\n\r\nSurrounding \"Fillmore West\" appears to be a background growing out of the border chaos, but is actually stylized green text on yellow:\r\n\r\nThurs Fri Sat. Oct 3 4 5 (lower left)\r\nLights by Holy See (lower right)\r\n\r\nBlack banner along top edge with red text: Bill Graham Presents in San Francisco; block of text along bottom edge with ticket locations.",
