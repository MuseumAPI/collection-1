    "description": "Central medallion shows a man and a crowned woman with lettering above their heads reading OKASA AKA UNI. The medallion is derived from one designed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary of England in 1935. This roundel is flanked by winged horses with human heads, elephants, ostriches, and two busts of elaborately coiffed women inscribed ADU LE APE. The ground is filled with dots, leaves, pineapples, and lozenges. Below, a border of letters and confronted birds. The cassava resist paste is applied through a stencil with a feather; the wavy lines are made with a comb.",
