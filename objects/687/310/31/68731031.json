    "description": "February poster for the Salzhaus. Tall, multicolored letters span the height of the vertical poster. They overlap and intersect with one another, to spell \"SALZ \/ HAUS.\" The letters are printed on a black ground.",
    "justification": "Felix Pf\u00e4ffli designed this poster to promote the music house Salzhaus in Winterthur, Switzerland. Salzhaus invites a different designer each month to design their program. They give no design brief, and the posters that they produce are remarkably varied. Pf\u00e4ffli decided to focus on a typographic design using the venue\u2019s name. He used a font that he had initially designed to be used for single-day workshops that he runs for his students. The fonts simplicity belies its more complex potential, for it is intended to \"distort, warp and disassemble\". Layered over each other, the letterforms read as a vibrant abstract composition as much as a linear rendering of a name.",
