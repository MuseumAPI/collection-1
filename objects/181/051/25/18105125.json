They are connected between each other by a cresting. Lambrequins hang downwards, as do tassels at the corners. The panels are framed by reed rinceaux. That beside the window is decorated with an urn surrounded by festoons. In the other panels hang festoons. A disk with superimposed garland hangs between them in the upper part of the back. In the lower panels are rosettes below. The mountings and the decoration of the bars are shown. The signature and the date, the latter in the foot have been erased.",
