    "biography": "Contemporary designer Emiliano Godoy was born in Mexico in 1974. He received his BA in industrial design from Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City in 1997, starting his own studio before graduation. After participating in a series of small projects, Godoy moved to New York City to enroll in Pratt Institute\u2019s graduate program in industrial design, completing it in 2004. He then returned to Mexico City to establish the current iteration of his design studio, Godoylab. He is also the design director for Pirwi, a furniture design firm. While Godoy\u2019s work is incredibly varied, encompassing lighting, tableware, chairs and other furniture, all of it shares a common thread of sustainability, both in the materials and making processes. He also works with local Mexican manufacturers to fabricate all of his projects. Godoy teaches design at Centro de Dise\u00f1o, Cine y Televisi\u00f3n in Mexico and has received international recognition and awards for his work.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.emilianogodoy.com\/about.php\nhttp:\/\/www.designboom.com\/design\/emiliano-godoy-interview\/\nhttp:\/\/www.emilianogodoy.com\/projects\/2012\/07\/19\/pedro-and-pablo\/\nhttp:\/\/www.dwell.com\/interviews\/article\/emiliano-godoy\nhttp:\/\/pirwi.com\/english\/disenadores\/emiliano-godoy-2\/\nhttp:\/\/www.contemporist.com\/2008\/08\/09\/designer-profile-emiliano-godoy\/",
