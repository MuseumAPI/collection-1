    "justification":"\nThis particular woven copper shielding fabric manufactured by Sefar America Incorporated in 2003 is an excellent fabric for shielding against electromagnetic interference in conference rooms and in hospitals. Used like a liner behind sheetrock or in between other layers of textiles, this shielding fabric is never meant to be seen like a decorative fabric. Its success is not based on beauty of draping but on how well it performs as a safeguard for equipment such as computers and other electronics. This textile demonstrates that as we test and ultimately push the physical boundaries in which we live and work, it is necessary to augment our tools as well as bodies with protective coverings that can insure operability and survival.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ",
