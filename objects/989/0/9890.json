  "description": "A group of female figures dressed in Classical garments are sitting and standing in the foreground.  To the left, is a monument comprised of a base, round pedestal, and bust of man's head.  Three flying figures are suspended directly above the monument.  Further to the left, is a stool upon which sits an incense burner.  Behind the stool are two tall pedestals with busts.  Behind the foreground grouping, to the right, is a round, colonnaded building with an inscription.  Directly behind the group is a smoke-filled middle ground.  In the distance another colonnaded building is visible.  A curtain frames the entire scene.",
