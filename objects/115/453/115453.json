  "description": "On a pebbly-textured background in the present black and white photograph, a tall, narrow rectangular box is displayed on the left. Two sides of the packaging, gray in the upper half and black in the lower, as well as the top, also gray, are visible. The logo, in white, centered in the upper half of each side and on the box top, is comprised of a circular rim enclosing the letters RCA in the designer's serif style type, with the left stroke of the A extending downward in a thunderbolt symbol. At the intersection of the black and gray areas is a frieze comprised of discretely rendered abstract foliate icons in black above a thin band of rickrack in white. Copy relating to the product fills the remaining space in the lower halves, and a continuing gray band just above the bottom is imprinted Radiotron. A circle of bold type in black surrounds the logo on the box top. The contents, a plug, are placed diagonally to the right and in front of the box. Dramatic lighting highlights the glass surface of the plug and casts deep shadows next to the box and plug on the right.",
