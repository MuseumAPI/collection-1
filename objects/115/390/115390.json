  "description": "The present object features a full-length advertisement in the left half of the page. Beginning just below the top edge, \"You're swell\" [script]/ says [script] Gustav/ Jensen [sans-serif capitals] is imprinted. A head shot of Jensen, his eyes glancing to the left, appears below the Jensen type line. The top left-hand corner of the rectangle enclosing the Jensen photograph intersects a circle containing a photograph of a 1928 Jensen design for a cigarette box (so identified in a three-line statement near the bottom of the page). Underneath the circle and to the left of Jensen's photograph, about/ Kimberly/ Drawing/ Pencils is imprinted, the bottom line aligned with the bottom edge of the Jensen photograph. Beginning slightly above the halfway mark on the page, the advertisement continues with a photograph of a pencil pointing downward, ending at the bottom of the page. Three paragraphs of copy occupy the space to the right of the pencil; the cigarette box statement beneath is accompanied by a hexagonal black-rimmed icon with a central dot. General/ Pencil Company/ Jersey City: New Jersey (underlined), in the right half of the advertisement space, completes the design.\r\n\r\nIt has not been determined if Jensen or someone else designed the advertisement. \r\n\r\n",
