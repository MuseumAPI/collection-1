    "description": "Aluminum stool of fluid biomorphic form, the slender, curving, tripod legs rising to a roughly triangular, up-turned and slanted seat\/suport with curled projection rising from one side;  the central leg with short spike-like projection as foot rest. The whole varnished in turquoise colored enamel.",
    "justification": "Phillipe Starck, the son of an aircraft designer, has frequently turned to aluminum as an expressive and durable design medium. He created the WW stool as part of a fantasy office environment for the German film director, Wim Wenders. This highly sculptural, organic form, a single piece of sand-cast aluminum finished in turquoise enamel, serves as a stool or a support while standing. The sand-casting technique was used to great advantage, resulting in a long, slender, flowing form. Vitra AG has produced the stool in a limited series since 1992. \nStarck has been designing since the late 1960s, when he worked for various companies including Pierre Cardin. He gained notoriety in the early 1980s when he was appointed to design a room in President Francois Mitterand\u2019s quarters in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. In 1984, he achieved international prominence, virtually overnight, with his design of the Caf\u00e9 Costes and the Costes chair produced by Driade. Since then, he has continued to be regarded as a leader of contemporary French design. His works include full interiors, their furnishings, table-top wares in a variety of media, and utilitarian items such as juicers and toothbrushes.",
