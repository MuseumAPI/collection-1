    "description":"The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of ochre, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, overprinted with silver metallic ink in a pattern of urns with foliage.",
    "justification":"This particular example of Carnavalet was designed by Fortuny and manufactured in his factory sometime during the 1930s and 40s. This particular textile is more difficult to date because the Fortuny Factory continues to use the same machines, dye recipes, techniques, and long-staple Egyptian cotton foundation now as then. This pattern was first printed in the 1930s and continues to be produced today in the same colorways. The dyed cotton and printed textile boasts a ground fabric with a marbled effect in shades of ochre, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, and then overprinted with silver metallic ink in a pattern of urns with foliage.",
