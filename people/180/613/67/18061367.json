    "biography":"Jun Tomita (b. 1951), a Japanese textile artist, has worked with the traditional dyeing technique of kasuri for over two decades while adding to the medium his own rich and contemporary interpretation. Kasuri, the Japanese word for ikat, which is derived from the Malay-Indonesian word mengikat meaning \u201cto tie or to bind\u201d, has been popular in Japan since the 17th century. Ikat however, was established much earlier, and was used only in very special circumstances on clothing worn mainly by the aristocracy.",
