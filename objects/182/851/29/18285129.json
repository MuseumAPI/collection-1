    "description": "Please note numbering changes as follows:  2 prints had not been numbered when accession numbers were originally marked (between the original 4 & 5 and bet. orig. 8 & 9); 1 print had been marked with 2 access. numbers, when in fact it was a folded sheet and should only have received 1 number (orig. 2 & 3).  Sheets 1 - 5 were reconciled easily; however all other numbers had to shift due to the missing number between 8 & 9.\n\nInventory team 2009\/2010",
