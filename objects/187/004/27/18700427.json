    "justification":"From Aquisition Justification:\n&quot;Castle was commissioned by Dr. Irwin&amp;nbsp;Berman to make this chest as a stereo cabinet.&amp;nbsp; This case piece is an outstanding example of the American studio furniture movement and is unique--one of only two chest types created in the early years of Castle's work. It is a variant of a blanket chest he crafted in 1968, housed in the collection of the University of Rochester, Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, New York. Wendell Castle is a pivotal figure in the studio craft movement. His work, grounded in a sensibility that draws from the fine arts and his training in industrial design, spans the fields of design, craft, and sculpture, and reflects a diverse approach to a number of materials from wood to plastics.\nFrom 1953-61, Castle was a student in the Design Department of the University of Kansas, where he also studied drawing, sculpture and jewelry.&amp;nbsp; After taking a brief leave in 1960 to design interiors and furniture for commercial manufacture, he decided to concentrate on sculpture, and received his Masters degree in 1961.&amp;nbsp; He eagerly followed the work of sculptors such as Isamu Noguchi, Henry Moore, Alexander Calder, and particularly Leonard Baskin, who treated large laminated blocks of wood like slabs of marble, creating simplified forms.&amp;nbsp; Still influenced by his industrial design studies, he also looked to figures such as the designer Don Wallance whose book of case studies, Shaping America's Products, demonstrated new approaches integrating art and utility. Among the figures Wallance studied were the artist-woodworker Wharton Esherick.&amp;nbsp; Castle felt an affinity with Esherick, who was trained in a formal academic art program and found a niche creating woodblock prints, sculpture and sculptural furniture.&amp;nbsp; Castle also appreciated his aesthetic, rejecting the use of rectilinear construction, and what Esherick thought to be bland, predictable lines of post-war wooden furniture.&amp;nbsp; He studied with Esherick, and produced his first pieces of furniture around 1959.\nBy the early sixties, Castle's reputation as a craft artist was growing, and his work was exhibited in New York at the then Museum of Contemporary Crafts as part of the Young Americans exhibition of 1962.&amp;nbsp; His success at that show brought him to the attention of Harold Brennan, Dean of fine and applied arts at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, New York.&amp;nbsp; Brennan was in the process of expanding the fine and applied arts departments, and offered Castle a teaching post at RIT, realizing that the nascent studio movement would have a growing impact on art and design.&amp;nbsp; Castle experimented freely in RIT's wood shop, utilizing a full range of power equipment.&amp;nbsp; He greatly expanded his technical repertoire and aesthetic sensibility, breaking further from traditional joinery and rectilinear furniture forms, and favoring a highly expressive organic approach to furniture construction and forms apparent in this chest.\nDuring this period, and lasting into the early 1970s, when this chest was made, Castle developed and refined a stack-laminating technique mainly used in construction of wooden objects from 19th-century duck decoys and figurative sculptures to large, modern abstract sculpture.&amp;nbsp; In this technique, boards or planks are stacked and glued together to form a mass, then carved into shape.&amp;nbsp; Castle developed a variation, as seen in this chest, in which planks were pre-shaped to follow the outline of the final form.&amp;nbsp; To accomplish this, he had to think of the form as a series of cross-sections and make careful calculations so the planks could be cut to closely fit the outer and inner contours of the form, making the construction of case pieces particularly challenging.&amp;nbsp; He would band-saw planks to the general shape, then glue them together, layer by layer.&amp;nbsp; Finally, he would further shape and smooth surfaces, inside and out, with power tools and hand tools.&quot;",
