    "biography": "Born in Hamburg, Germany, goldsmith and jewelry designer John Iversen has lived and worked in the New York area for about 30 years. Iversen apprenticed in Vancouver, Canada, and has practiced his craft in both the United States and abroad. He has been acknowledged as a master craftsman whose work shows a deep respect for materials:  \u201c...my jewelry is about the secret which lies hidden in the materials I use. It wants to be discovered.\u201d He also finds inspiration in organic forms and surfaces. Working in gold, silver and bronze, Iversen makes casts of leaves and blossoms directly from nature, to create a delicate, contemporary artistic concept of that leaf or blossom as a jewel. Iversen\u2019s technical virtuosity and experimental and innovative approach have garnered recognition, such as the George Jensen Award at the Smithsonian Craft Show, and the Vandura Prize for Jewelry at the Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show. His works are in the collections of major museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, and the Renwick Gallery.",
